            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

<pb facs="tcp:42750:3"/> who trained you up from your Child-hood in the holy Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and in the fear of the Lord, as alſo in all vertue be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeeming your Quality and Sex; whereof I have had the honour and happineſs to be a witneſs for many years. I know it is a Chriſtian duty, in the due time to make honourable mention of the vertues of the deceaſed Saints, to the end theſe who ſurvive them, may in a godly emulation follow their good example. Your Noble Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, was like to <hi>Annah</hi> in her privat and publick De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votions;
<pb facs="tcp:42750:3"/> like to <hi>Dorcas</hi> in her Chriſtian compaſſion and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to the neceſſitous; like to <hi>Sarah</hi> in her dutiful deport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment toward her Noble Lord your Father; and like to <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nice,</hi> in the Chriſtian and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der education of her Children. The other part of that Golden Sentence, ye your ſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour, through Gods grace to make good; by reſembling her in her Graces and Vertues; and by tranſmitting the ſame in your careful education of theſe hopeful young Ladies,

            <p>The like great obligation of Gratitude, that ſtrongly inclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to dedicat a Book to your gracious Mother, hath alſo prompted me to preſent this ſmall Treatiſe unto your La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſhips, and to honour the ſame by prefixing your Names thereto.

<pb facs="tcp:42750:4"/> ſouls; and in this, is held forth the Righteous BRANCH, even the bleſſed Lord Jeſus Chriſt alſo, for the reviving of fainting ſouls, by the ſweet ſavour of his grace and power, to convert and ſave loſt man.</p>
            <p>It is not in ſuch a dreſs, as will pleaſe the fancy of ſome others; but I know well, if the ſtuff be upright and ſolid, your ſober minds can eaſily diſpenſe with the want of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broideries of Humane Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence: That it may be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable to your Ladyſhips, and to all who ſhall be pleaſed to

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>He deſire of light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, is natural unto every man; as by the outward light, things viſible are ſeen by the eye of the body, So things intelligible, are perceived by the light and the knowledge in the mind: but of all knowledge, the knowledge of God in Jeſus Chriſt his bleſſed Son our Mediator, is moſt to be deſired. It is moſt neceſſar, becauſe the ſpecular knowledge of this in the holy Scriptures, is the Rudiment of that full and perfect knowledge the Saints
<pb facs="tcp:42750:6"/> have in Heaven; for to know this, is life eternal, <hi>Joh 17.3.</hi> It is the foundation of our ſpiritual practical duties; without it, man cannot believe in God and whom he ſent Jeſus Chriſt; for, <hi>how ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard?</hi> Rom. <hi>10.14.</hi> without this know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, we cannot deſire nor ſeek after Chriſt and his benefits; therefore our bleſsed Lord ſaid to that poor ſinful woman, <hi>Joh. 4.10. If thou kneweſt the gift of God, and who it is that ſaith to thee, give me to drink, thou wouldeſt have asked of him, and he would have given thee living wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> For, the <hi>will</hi> cannot love and chuſe Chriſt for our portion, till firſt he be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in his beauty of holineſs by light and knowledge in the underſtanding. This knowledge is moſt excellent in reſpect of the ſubject, who is <hi>the brightneſs of the Fathers glory,</hi> in <hi>whom</hi> are hid the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of wiſdom and knowledge: All na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural knowledge, though never ſo profound, as was that of <hi>Solomon,</hi> who knew and ſpoke of all Trees from the <hi>Cedar</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop;</hi> yet, if we be ignorant of the true <hi>Vine,</hi> and of the righteous <hi>BRANCH</hi> that
<pb facs="tcp:42750:6"/> healeth the Nations, all our ſecular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge will prove unſavory and guſtleſs at the hour of death: but if we know, love and obey in ſincerity the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then at the end of our life, we ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in our longing deſire, and lively hope to be with him after death, and to know him as now we are known of him. This knowledge is not dull, but active; by our knowledge of him, we are juſtified, <hi>Iſ. 53.11.</hi> Saving faith, whereof <hi>knowledge</hi> is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial and firſt ingredient, receiveth Chriſt wholly in all his Offices, and with him pardon of our ſins; as all who were ſtung in the wilderneſs, if they looked to the braſen Serpent, were healed; So <hi>whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever believeth in him, ſhall not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> This knowledge is active alſo for our Sanctification; becauſe this knowledge, by the obſignation of the holy Spirit, maketh ſuch a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Chriſt known, upon the minds and hearts of believers, that they become like and conform unto him, <hi>2 Pet. 1.4.</hi> and by the knowledge and light of the Goſpel, repreſenting him, they are changed from glory to glory, <hi>2 Cor. 3.18.</hi> that is, from
<pb facs="tcp:42750:7"/> one degree of grace to another in the courſe and progreſs of Sanctification, which is no other thing, but the commencement of that glory we look for in heaven. This ſaving knowledge, which true believers have of Chriſt, is an humbling and encreaſing know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge; <hi>Paul</hi> became very humble, thinking himſelf the chief of ſinners, and leaſt of Saints; it is a growing light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the more they know him, they love him the more; and the more they love him, they deſire to know the more of him. When they grow old, and the natural faculty of underſtanding waxeth weak and dim, though they grow not in the knowledge of the lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral apprehenſion, yet they grow in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of appretiation and eſtimation; as the motion of every thing, the nearer it comes to its center, is the ſwifter; So the ſound be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, the nearer he draws to the term of his life and the hoped for fruition, the center of all his deſires and hopes, the motion of his heart toward God is the greater, and he vehemently deſires to be diſſolved and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</p>
            <p>This knowledge, in ſome abſtruſe and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural myſteries, is but confuſe and general; we know from divine revelation
<pb facs="tcp:42750:7"/> ſomething of the <hi>matter,</hi> but little or no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the <hi>manner;</hi> It is our duty to acquieſce on divine teſtimony, and refer the knowledge of the <hi>manner</hi> unto that day, wherein we ſhall ſee God face to face. It is with us here in this dark valley of <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca,</hi> as it was with that blind man of <hi>Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaida,</hi> Mark <hi>9.</hi> who at the firſt touch of his eyes by Chriſt, did ſee objects more generally and confuſedly, but afterward at the ſecond touch, more particularly and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly: So here in this life, by his firſt touch and illumination of our mind with the light of faith, we ſee ſomething of theſe great myſteries in a confuſed and general notion but at his ſecond touch in heaven, by the beatifick viſion, we ſhall know di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinctly and more particularly, at the leaſt we ſhall know ſo much in theſe high myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, as will ſatisfie the deſire of the ſoul, and will rejoyce the heart, without all anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous or painful deſire to know more.</p>
            <p>Therefore (Chriſtian Reader) I made choice to ſpeak in the publick Congregation, for ſome time, on this portion of Scripture, wherein the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous <hi>BRANCH,</hi> is held forth to us,
<pb facs="tcp:42750:8"/> that coming to him, we may be healed, both of ſin, in our juſtification through him, who is <hi>JEHOVAH our Righteouſneſs;</hi> and that we may be ſanctified, and daily puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied from all uncleanneſs of the fleſh and ſpirit by him, who alſo is made of God, ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification unto us, who bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs. This knowledge is moſt to be ſought after; for as the faſhion of this world paſseth away, ſo certainly, the knowledge of things worldly will be out of faſhion after death: but the knowledge of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, begun in the Elect here by faith unto the Goſpel, will be perfect and everlaſting in that day of eternity, when the Lamb will be our light for ever.</p>
            <p>If thou (ingenuous Reader) ſhall reap, as I pray God thou mayeſt, any ſpiritual benefit by this ſmall Treatiſe, publiſhed at the deſire of ſome pious and ſober minded hearers, give all praiſe to the <hi>Righteous BRANCH,</hi> who, as he is in himſelf moſt precious, ſo he maketh himſelf ſavoury and precious to believers: And that it may be ſeen he is ſo to thee, let thy converſation ſmell of the
<pb facs="tcp:42750:8"/> 
               <hi>BRANCH.</hi> What eſcapes thou perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt (as in the multitude of words there want not failings) impute them meerly to the weakneſs of the trembling hand here, that holds forth the <hi>BRANCH,</hi> but no wayes to the <hi>BRANCH</hi> it ſelf. Though poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly thou cannot conſtruct ſome expreſsions in this Treatiſe, with thine own ſentiment and opinion; yet certainly, the intention of the Author, to magnifie the riches and power of Goſpel-grace in the converſion of chief ſinners, and his earneſt endeavours to ſtir up <hi>Converts</hi> unto a ſuitable converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Chriſtian duties, and unto Chriſtian communion in love and peace among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, cannot be diſrelliſhed by any perſon of the Goſpel-ſpirit. <hi>Farewell.</hi>

               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is uſual and worthy of the holy Prophets, in ſpeaking of temporal mercies and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveries of the people of God from their enemies, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert ſomething, by way of Propheſie, like a bright co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour, to give luſtre to tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral benefits, by ſpeaking ſomething anent our ſpiritual and eternal redemption by the promiſed <hi>Meſſias:</hi> Thus the ſame Prophet, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:42750:10"/> propheſied of the temporal deliverance of the Jews, from the combination of the Kings of <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> ſubjoyns an Evangelical Propheſie concerning the coming of the <hi>Meſſias, Iſa.</hi> 7.14. The Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi> having ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken, (<hi>Chap.</hi> 23.) of the return of the Jews from the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> ſubjoyns, (<hi>verſ.</hi> 6) a Propheſie of the kingdom and benefits of the <hi>Meſſias;</hi> as alſo, the like is done, <hi>Jer.</hi> 33.15.</p>
            <p>In like manner, the Prophet here having fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told their deliverance from <hi>Sennacherib,</hi> King of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> ſubjoyns a gracious and comfortable Propheſie of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> his birth, government, and the deliverance and redemption both of Jews and Gentiles from their ſpiritual enemies, by their happy converſion to the faith of the promiſed <hi>Meſſias.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Chapter, from the beginning to <hi>verſ.</hi> 10. we have theſe particulars; 1. The low be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning and original of the <hi>Meſſias,</hi> ſet forth in borrowed expreſſions. 2. His ſingular endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and qualifications for executing the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Mediator, and for governing his Church, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. 3. The manner of his government, <hi>verſ.</hi> 3, 4, 5. 4. The effects of his government, <hi>verſ.</hi> 6, 7, 8, 9. 5. The cauſe of theſe effects, in the end of <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. <hi>For the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. By <hi>rod,</hi> or <hi>twigg,</hi> we underſtand the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as a ſmall twigg, ſprouting
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:42750:10"/> up from <hi>Jeſſe</hi> the father of <hi>David:</hi> He is ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in reſpect of his outward, low and humble condition in the world; as it is alſo ſaid, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2. <hi>He ſhall grow up as a root out of a dry ground: he hath no form nor comlineſs,</hi> &amp;c. Which is not to be underſtood, in relation to the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward form or feature of his body, which, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all queſtion, was moſt comely, having its conſtitution and complexion framed in a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar manner by the Holy Ghoſt; but it is ſpoken in reſpect of his outward condition and eſtate in the world; becauſe he was born in a poor Cortage, without all outward Pomp and State, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.7. This propheſie of Chriſts deſcending from the loyns of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly fulfilled, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.23.</p>
            <p>By <hi>Branch,</hi> is meant our bleſſed Lord, who is ſo called, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Zechar.</hi> 3.8. and 6.12. In which places the 70. Interpreters render it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Oriens;</hi> and in this Text they render it <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, <hi>Flos;</hi> becauſe he was in dignity the <hi>firſt-born</hi> and <hi>flower</hi> of all the creatures. To theſe places of holy Scripture, wherein our bleſſed Lord is called the <hi>Branch,</hi> many learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Interpreters do think, that place, <hi>Matth.</hi> 2.23. <hi>he ſhall be called a Nazaren,</hi> doth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late; he was called a <hi>Nazaren,</hi> that is, <hi>the Branch,</hi> from the City <hi>Nazareth,</hi> where he had his education, it being a City compaſſed about with buſhy trees; as even at this day, the Jews call a Chriſtian, <hi>Natzar.</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="4" facs="tcp:42750:11"/>
            <p>It is ſaid, <hi>out of his roots;</hi> becauſe at the time of Chriſts birth, tbe family of <hi>David,</hi> the ſon of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> was like a root hid under the ground in time of Winter; becauſe after the captivity of <hi>Babylon,</hi> none of the Tribe of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi> had the government; but at that time the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> were the ſupreme Rulers: at the birth of our Lord, <hi>Herod</hi> the Great, the ſon of <hi>Antipater,</hi> ſlew all of the Sanedrim, who were for the moſt part of the royal Tribe of <hi>Judah:</hi> then was ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled that Propheſie of the Patriarch <hi>Jacob,</hi> concerning the departure of the Scepter from <hi>Judah,</hi> and of a Law-giver from between his feet, when <hi>Shiloh</hi> was born into the world, <hi>Gen.</hi> 49.10. At our Lords birth, the family of <hi>David,</hi> in reſpect of any outward ſplendor, was like a root hid under the ground in Winter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time: but the Lord who quickens the dead, made this root to ſprout, and bring forth this Plant of Renown, even the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. It is the duty of the people of God to raiſe up their thoughts, from any tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral deliverance promiſed or received, unto the meditation, and conſideration of that ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and eternal redemption, wrought be Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt: This is clear from the coherence of this Chapter with the preceeding; 1. Becauſe all our temporal mercies and deliverances, are nothing in compariſon of that precious, full and eternal redemption, purchaſed by Jeſus
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:42750:11"/> Chriſt: if we conſider the price of our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, even the precious blood of the Lamb of God, of infinite worth and value above all things corruptible, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.18, 19. we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed and delivered from all our enemies, <hi>Luk.</hi> 1.74. and it is an eternal redemption, that in the effects of it endureth for ever, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.12. 2. Temporal deliverances are common to the wicked, as well as to the godly; in which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, Chriſt is called the Saviour of all men, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.10. 3. Wicked men may receive a great temporal deliverance, who are yet reſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for wrath to come, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Jud.</hi> v. 13. Curſed <hi>Cham</hi> was delivered from the deluge, and many damned Sodomites were delivered by <hi>Abraham</hi> from captivity, at the reſcue of <hi>Lot</hi> from his enemies.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Obſer.</hi> 2. Our bleſſed Lord humbled himſelf to a low condition here on earth; he was as a <hi>rod</hi> or ſmall <hi>twigg,</hi> out of the family of <hi>Jeſſe,</hi> one of the ſmalleſt in the Tribe of <hi>Judah.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider well his Humiliation, 1. It was voluntar and free, <hi>Philip.</hi> 2.7, 8. <hi>he emptied himſelf;</hi> as he laid aſide his upper garment to waſh the feet of his Diſciples, ſo he laid aſide outward ſtate and glory, that he might ſuffer for us, and waſh us in his precious blood. 2. It was a gracious and bountiful Humiliation and Exinanition on our behalf, that by the merit thereof, he might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rich us with his unſearchable and durable riches, even with the graces of the holy Spirit, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:42750:12"/> to us by the merit of his death, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8, 9. <hi>Though he was rich, yet for your ſakes he became poor, that ye through his poverty might be made rich,</hi> and thereby alſo to exalt us unto glory, and ſet us in heavenly places together with himſelf, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.10. <hi>For it became him for whom are all things, and by whom are all things, in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing many ſons unto glory, to make the Captain of their ſalvation perfect through ſufferings.</hi> The merit of his Humiliation was as a Ladder fixed on the earth, for us to aſcend thereby unto glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. 3. He came in a low condition, for the comfort of many of the godly, who are born and live in a poor and low condition here on earth; their low and deſpicable condition in the world, ſhall not be any prejudice to the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of their ſouls, for Chriſt ſhall be <hi>all</hi> to them, and <hi>all</hi> in them, <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 3.11. <hi>Lazarus</hi> a poor man, and <hi>Oneſimus</hi> a ſervant, are accepted of God in him. 4. He became low, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected himſelf to infirmities, that thereby we might have confidence of pity and help to us in the day of our infirmities, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.15, 16. He knoweth from experience, what it is to have an heart overwhelmed with grief, or aſtoniſhed with fear; for his ſoul was in an agony, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.44 and he was ſore amazed through fear, and very heavy in heart through grief, <hi>Mark</hi> 14.33.</p>
            <p n="5">5. He came in a low condition, to teach us to be content in our loweſt eſtate; in thy low Cottage be content, and look to the Heir of
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:42750:12"/> heaven, born in a poor out-houſe: though thou have courſe fair, be content, and look to him, who in his ordinar entertainment, had but a few barley Loaves and ſome ſmall Fiſhes: at the evening of the day, though thou get a hard bed, look up to him and be content, for he had not whereon to lay his head, <hi>Mat.</hi> 8.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Be not offended at Chriſts low eſtate, <hi>Bleſſed is the man,</hi> ſaith our Lord, <hi>that is not offended in me:</hi> remember, 1. he was brought low for our cauſe, <hi>he was bruiſed for our ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quities;</hi> our lifting up of our ſelves in the pride and rebellion of our hearts againſt God, brought him low to ſuffer and ſatisfie the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Juſtice in our nature for us. Should a Debter be aſhamed of, or deſpiſe his Cautio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, brought low only by his ſuretyſhip for his debts, and not for any of his own perſon? 2. That thou may not be offended at his out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward low condition, look by the piercing eye of Faith, into the inſide of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>in him the God-head dwels bodily,</hi> Col. 2.9. His Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature was like the vail, that hid what was within the moſt holy place; but draw aſide the vail, and by Faith behold in <hi>him, the moſt holy One,</hi> that Mercy-ſeat and Propitiatory, in whom and by whom we get a gracious anſwer of peace from the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.23. <hi>Verily, verily, I ſay unto you, whatſoever ye ſhall ask the Father in my name, he will give it you.</hi> He is our propitiation, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. By Faith, look through
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:42750:13"/> the vail of the Humane Nature, and behold in him the pot of heavenly Manna, which deſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, not only from the clouds, as that Manna in the wilderneſſe, but from the third heaven, to give life unto the world: By Faith, behold in him the rod of <hi>Aaron</hi> the high Prieſt, ever bloſſoming; for he is our great high Prieſt, living for ever in the moſt holy place, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.24. and by the ſpecial aſſiſtance of the holy Ghoſt, according to his promiſe, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20. he mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the preaching of the Goſpel by his Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters, not only to bloſſom in a fair outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, but alſo to be fruitful in the converſati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his people. 3. Conſider, although our bleſſed Lord was born, and lived in a low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, yet ſome glimpſes of the glory of his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Nature, did now and then at his own plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, break through the vail of his Humane Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: although he was low in the place of his birth, yet at the ſame time he was attended by an heavenly hoſt of Angels, and was worſhipped both by the wiſe men that came from the eaſt, and by the ſhepherds: after he was tempted as a man in the wilderneſs, yet the Angels mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtered unto him as the Son of God: after his ſleeping as a man in the ſhip, he rebuked the Sea and the Winds as the Son of God: yea, in his loweſt condition upon the Croſs, he by the power of his God-head, did ſhake the earth and raiſe the dead.</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. Meditate oft-times for thy comfort, upon his lowing and humbling himſelf in his birth, life and death, look upon it as the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt token of his love: <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſervice in ſo low a condition, was a great token of his love to <hi>Rachel;</hi> but the Prince of Glory, even <hi>Jacobs</hi> Lord, was in the form of a ſervant, near-by thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four years, to eſpouſe us who were by nature enemies to God. Look upon his low condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and humiliation, as a ſpecial mean to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thy heart and affection to himſelf, who took upon him thy nature, to make thee par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker of the Divine Nature, by a conformity to God in holineſs in this life, and in glory and happineſs for ever in the other life. Look up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on his humiliation, as thy pattern in thy beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour to thy inferiours; he condeſcended to us in our low eſtate, therefore be not high-minded, neither in a ſupercilious arrogancy ſtand upon your punctilio's; but let the like mind be in you which was in Chriſt Jeſus, who hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled himſelf to do us good: So ſhould we, after his example, condeſcend to do good one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.3, 4, 5.</p>

How is it that the graces of the Spirit beſtowed upon him, are here ſtinted and limited to the number of ſix? 2.

What is meant by theſe ſeveral graces and gifts mentioned here?</p>
               <p>I anſwer to the firſt, The graces reckoned up here, are ſuch as were beſtowed upon him, as Man and Mediator in our nature at his Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and were requiſit for him in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his Church and people; although all other graces were habitually and eminently in him, as <hi>humility, meekneſs, patience,</hi> &amp;c. yet ſuch graces are mentioned here, as in a ſpecial
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:42750:14"/> manner qualified him for the actual diſcharge of the Mediatory-office: as for that ſpoken of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.34. <hi>He received not the ſpirit by meaſure;</hi> it is not to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſimply, as if the Humane Nature of Chriſt, by way of transfuſion, had received an infinit meaſure of grace; for a finit creature cannot receive ſuch a meaſure, ſeing every thing is received according to the meaſure and capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of the receiver: but it is ſpoken by way of compariſon, with all the intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, Angels, or Men, who received not ſuch a meaſure of the graces of the Spirit, as Chriſt did in his Humane Nature, wherein he was anointed above his fellows, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.7.</p>
               <p>To the ſecond Queſtion I anſwer, Our bleſſed Lord, in reſpect of his Divine Nature, was of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finit underſtanding, wiſdom, counſel, might and knowledge: but theſe graces, in a finit mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, were communicat to the Humane Nature, in the perſonal union thereof with the Divine Nature in his Incarnation, but in a meaſure far above the capacity of Angels or Men; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the nearer the creature is united to God, the perfection of it is the greater: therefore it is even ſo among believers in the Church here on earth, ſome of them are more perfect then others, becauſe united to God by more of faith and love then others: and in Heaven, the Saints glorified, are more perfect then the Saints militant on earth; becauſe they are
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:42750:15"/> united and near to God in the facial viſion of God by full knowledge and perfect love: Now, of all creatures, the Humane Nature of Chriſt, was and is moſt perfect, becauſe united and neareſt to the Divine Nature in a perſonal union.</p>
               <p>To the third I anſwer; We underſtand by the <hi>Spirit of underſtanding,</hi> his large capacity in perceiving and up-taking, what was incumbent for himſelf to do and ſuffer as our Mediator; and alſo, what the elect ſhould do for attaining eternal life through him: By the <hi>Spirit of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> we underſtand the gift of active prudence, whereby he was enabled for doing and perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the duty, which he underſtood was incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent to him as our Mediator, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 40.8, 9, 10. <hi>I have not hid thy righteouſneſs within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulneſs and thy ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I have not concealed thy loving kindneſs and thy truth from the great congregation.</hi> By the <hi>Spirit of counſel,</hi> we underſtand his ability to reveal the eternal counſel and purpoſe of the Father, concerning the way of mans ſalvation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>And this it the will of him that ſent me, that every one which ſeeth the Son, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveth on him, may have everlaſting life.</hi> By the <hi>Spirit of might,</hi> we underſtand that power and dominion over all creatures, given to him as Mediator and Head of his Church, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.18. <hi>All power is given unto me in Heaven and in Earth.</hi> An exceeding power of invincible grace
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:42750:15"/> toward the Elect in their effectual calling and converſion, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. and alſo a power and mighty force to ſubdue his obſtinat and incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rigible enemies, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.25. <hi>For he muſt reign, till he hath put all enemies under his feet.</hi> By the <hi>Spirit of knowledge,</hi> we underſtand, not only his certain and infallible knowledge of all things to be done and ſuffered by him, for the ſalvation of loſt man; but alſo his knowledge and dexterity for inſtructing his Church in the truth and way of ſalvation. As in the Breaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate of the High Prieſt was <hi>

<pb n="14" facs="tcp:42750:16"/> from the perſonal union: for it is ſaid, <hi>He knew in himſelf,</hi> to wit, from the God-head dwelling in him perſonally, <hi>Luk.</hi> 8.46. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.61. but the knowledge of the Prophets and Apoſtles was extrinſecal by inſpiration, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary revelation. By the <hi>ſpirit of the fear of the Lord,</hi> we underſtand that heavenly grace of unſpotted holineſs and purity in his Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Nature; for <hi>ſuch an High Prieſt became us, who is holy, harmleſs, undefiled,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.26. therefore is he called by way of ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity and excellency <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, that <hi>Holy Thing,</hi> Luk. 1.35. The words being thus explained, two things may be obſerved, 1. The variety of the graces and gifts powred forth upon our Lord Jeſus Chriſt for the good of his Church. 2. The permanency and continuance of theſe graces and gifts in vigor and exerciſe; it is ſaid, <hi>The Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt upon him.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Variety of graces and gifts were poured forth upon Jeſus Chriſt our Head, for the good of all the members of his myſtical body the <hi>Church:</hi> this is evident from this place, as alſo from <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.14, 16. <hi>He was full of grace and truth, and of his fulneſs have we all received, and grace for grace.</hi> As the ointment poured forth upon the head of <hi>Aaron,</hi> the High Prieſt, did flow down to the skirts of his garment, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 133.1. in like manner, the ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the graces of the Spirit poured forth on Jeſus Chriſt our great High Prieſt, doth deſcend
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:42750:16"/> to the meaneſt member of his myſtical body for ſanctifying them throughout, and for gladning their hearts with that oyl of gladneſs ſpoken of, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.7, 8. It is ſaid (<hi>Eph.</hi> 4.10.) <hi>He aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended up far above all Heavens, that he might fill all things.</hi> It is true, believers were filled in ſome meaſure with grace through him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his aſcending into Heaven; yet a greater meaſure of the Spirit was poured forth upon them after his aſcenſion, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.33. as the Sun after its riſing fills the earth with light; but the higher it aſcends in its courſe, the earth is filled with more of light; ſo there is a greater meaſure of ſpiritual knowledge and grace in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers after the aſcenſion of Chriſt, then was before his birth, or during the time of his abode upon the earth in the time of his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliation.</p>

<pb n="16" facs="tcp:42750:17"/> we may be aſſured he is faithful in all the Houſe of God, to give unto the children their Fathers allowance, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.27. <hi>Labour not for the meat which periſheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlaſting life, which the ſon of man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Art thou dull in underſtanding, and hath little or no ſharpneſs of wit to underſtand and diſcern ſpiritual and ſupernatural truths, no more then a blind man has ſight to diſcern co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours?

Seek it with a ſincere purpoſe of heart to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove thy underſtanding of the truth revealed unto practice, and doing what thou ſhalt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand to be Gods will and thy duty. Go with confidence to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is both able and willing to open thy underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and to give a heavenly faculty to perceive and underſtand divine truths. He not only taught the Diſciples going to <hi>Emmaus,</hi> by word of mouth; but alſo opened their underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, <hi>Luke</hi> 24.44. And if thou have an honeſt purpoſe of heart, to do revealed duties, thy Lord will mak thee to underſtand and diſcern the truths that are neceſſary for the ſaving of thy ſoul, <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.17. <hi>If any man will do his will,

               <p>Wouldſt thou have ſpiritual wiſdom and prudence for ordering thy converſation, and doing of revealed duties? Go to him, upon whom was poured the ſpirit of wiſdom; by prayer ſeek it of him who gives liberally, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. Make conſcience of frequent hearing and reading the Word of God, which is the book of heavenly wiſdom, making men wiſe to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15, 16.</p>
               <p>In difficulties and perplexities, wherein thou knows no more what to do, then <hi>Jehoſhaphat</hi> did in a great ſtrait, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 20.12. go to him for counſel, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.14. <hi>Counſel is mine.</hi> And here it is ſaid, <hi>The ſpirit of counſel was upon him:</hi> He is called, by way of excellency, <hi>The Counſeller,</hi> Iſai. 9.6.

Seing theſe graces and gifts of the Spirit were given to Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, for the benefit of his Church, it is our duty to ſearch our ſelves, and try if we have received of the ſpirit of Chriſt: becauſe, <hi>if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>And hereby know we that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> 1 Joh. 4.13.

               </p>
               <p>His Spirit is a Spirit of underſtanding; If thou underſtand the fundamental and neceſſary ſaving truths, and followeſt Chriſt by ſaith, as a Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar following and maintaining the opinion of his Teacher; and if thou ſet thy heart to follow him by obedience, in the way of his holy Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments, as a Servant following the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

If thou be wiſe in this manner, then thou mayeſt be aſſured thou haſt received of the Spirit of wiſdom, that reſted on Chriſt thy Head.</p>
               <p>The Spirit of Chriſt was a Spirit of ſound counſel; if thou has received of that Spirit, thou wilt not give pernicious counſel to others, as <hi>Jonadab</hi> did to <hi>Ammon,</hi> to further them in any ſinful courſe; nor wilt thou give counſel

               <p>The power of the wicked is finit and limited, but his power, being God, is infinit, and there is no proportion between finit and infinit.

Their Head, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, is now far above all the waters of affliction and perſecution; he can reſtrain their malice; he cuts the horn of the wicked, he breaks their teeth, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 3.7. although they bark, yet they bite not; or if he permit them to bite, yet their bite is not deadly, like that of ſome mad dogs; he can put a bridle in the jaws of <hi>Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacherib;</hi> he can defeat their counſels and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trivances, as he did that of <hi>Achitophel,</hi> turned it to folly and ruine to himſelf: he did defeat and wonderfully diſappoint the counſel of <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> againſt <hi>Mordecai,</hi> according to that of <hi>Job</hi> 5.13. <hi>He taketh the wiſe in their own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and the counſel of the froward is carried head-long:</hi> and in his unſearchable wiſdom, he turns their malice to the praiſe of his great Name, who is mighty to ſave his people, maugre

               <p>There is no might nor power worldly, that can overthrow the Church of Chriſt, <hi>The gates of hell ſhall not prevail againſt it,</hi> Mat. 16.18. Becauſe it is built on him who is the Rock of Ages, and is the ſtrength of all, who by faith are built on him; they are kept by the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.29. and by the power of God through ſaith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.

It is true, the Lord doth not alwayes ſhew his might in holding off the trouble from them; yet he makes manifeſt his might and power in uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them under troubles, and in ſtrengthning them to patience and long-ſuffering with joy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs: they are <hi>caſt down, but not deſtroyed; perſecuted, but not forſaken; perplexed, but not in deſpair,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.9. Pſal. 46.5.

<pb n="27" facs="tcp:42750:22"/> the preſent pain and throws from a bitter poti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, by confirming him in the hope of better health thereafter, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.20. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.17. Sometimes he comforts them with a ſenſe of his love, ſhed abroad in their hearts by the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt; which, as a cordial, doth preſerve and revive them, that they faint not altogether in times of great trouble, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.3, 4. As a tender father ſpeaketh more kindly to his ſick child, then he was wont to do formerly in time of his better health; ſo the Lord ſpeaketh comfort to them by his Spirit according to the word of promiſe, when they are in a deſolate condition, like unto a wilderneſs, wherein they have none or few to ſpeak a word of comfort unto them, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Stephen</hi> the Martyr, had never ſuch a manifeſtation of Gods graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous preſence, as in the day of his greateſt affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction and perſecution, <hi>Acts</hi> 7.56. And the young Confeſſor <hi>Theodorus</hi> (as teſtifies <hi>Euſebi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us</hi>) felt never more ſweetneſs, then in the time he was upon the rack. Conſider, the merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Lord moderats their afflictions in the <hi>ſpecie</hi> or kind in not ſending alwayes his ſoreſt plagues: Sometimes in the number, he lays not on all his rods, <hi>he ſtayeth his rough wind, in the day of the eaſt-wind,</hi> Iſa. 27.8. Sometimes in the degree and meaſure, in not afflicting them in extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, <hi>The Lord hath chaſtiſed me ſore,</hi> (ſaith <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid) but he hath not given me over to death,</hi> Pſal. 118.18. And he moderats the afflictions
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:42750:23"/> in reſpect of the time and endurance, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 125.3. <hi>The rod of the wicked ſhall not reſt upon the lot of the righteous, leſt the righteous put forth their hands unto iniquity.</hi> The Lord by the ſpirit of wiſdom and power, turns all their afflictions, in end, for their ſpiritual advantage, <hi>By this ſhall the iniquity of Jacob be purged, and this is all the fruit, to take away his ſin,</hi> Iſa. 27.9. Dan. 12.10. <hi>They ſhall be made white,</hi> &amp;c. And many times he orders their afflictions to the good of others, who are confirmed in the way of truth and righteouſneſs, from the example of their patience in ſuffering for the truth, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. The diſperſing of ſome Chriſtians in that perſecution againſt <hi>Stephen,</hi> was in the wiſdom and power of God, ordered for the in gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of many people in <hi>Samaria</hi> unto the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian faith, <hi>Acts</hi> 8.</p>

As the gifts and graces of the Spirit were poured forth upon Chriſt in great variety, ſo they were permanent and abiding in him, without any change, and without remit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting of their vigour and exerciſe upon all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>the Spirit of the Lord ſhall reſt on him.</hi> The Spirit which deſcended from Heaven like a Dove, did abide upon him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.32. The extraordinary gift of revealing things ſecret, by the light of Propheſie, was not at all times per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in the Prophets, 2 <hi>King.</hi> 4.27. As light within the houſe occaſioned by lightning in the air, is tranſient and not permanent, ſo neither
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:42750:23"/> was the gift of miracles, or healing the ſick, alwayes permanent in our Lords Diſciples, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.18. Yea <hi>Paul</hi> left his beloved <hi>Trophimus,</hi> ſick at <hi>Miletum,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.20. But our bleſſed Lord healed all, whom and when he pleaſed. It is true, the ſanctifying graces in the Elect, are alwayes permanent, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.14. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit ſin, for his ſeed remaineth in him; and he cannot ſin, becauſe he is born of God.</hi> They are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manent in reſpect of the root, of the ſeed, and of the habit; but not in reſpect of the fruit and exerciſe; but the graces of Chriſt were ever flouriſhing and fruitful, Graces in the godly, have decays and changes; even <hi>Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham,</hi> the father of the faithful, had a fit of diffidence, when in his fear he diſſembled twice, to wit, in <hi>Gerar</hi> and in <hi>Egypt;</hi> but our bleſſed Lord, his confidence was permanent in the hour of temptation, for he witneſſed a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, even to the laſt, before <hi>Pontius Pilat. Moſes</hi> was a meek man, yet was ſurpriſed with a fit of bitterneſs at <hi>Meribah:</hi> but our bleſſed Lord was meek at all times; for, his ſcourging out the profaners of the Temple, (<hi>Joh.</hi> 2.) was not a fit of paſſion and perturbation, but an heroick act of holy zeal, proceeding from judgement and deliberation, becauſe it was written, <hi>His Fathers houſe ſhould be the houſe of prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The habits of grace in Chriſt, were full and
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:42750:24"/> perfect: whereas it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.52. <hi>He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed in wiſdom.</hi> We grant he increaſt in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and in knowledge experimental, <hi>he learned obedience, by the things which he ſuffered,</hi> Heb. 5.8. as a Phyſician, who hath an habitual gift of healing ſuch and ſuch a diſeaſe, may grow in his experience, although his knowledge of healing, groweth not in the <hi>habit:</hi> It is a growth extenſive in reſpect of divers objects, toward which it is extended; but it is not intenſive in reſpect of the habit it ſelf. The graces of Chriſt were permanent in their fulneſs, and not more remiſs at one time, and more intenſe at another; becauſe the abſolute fulneſs of grace in his Humane Nature (ſo far as it could be capable) being a ſequel of the perſonal union, did exclude all intenſive growth: It is true, there were different degrees in the manifeſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and expreſſions of his graces at one time more than at another. Chriſt his dying for us, was an higher expreſſion of his love to loſt man, than was his ſuffering of poverty, hunger, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet all the expreſſions of his love to the elect, did proceed from love in his heart, equally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, at all times: More of his patience was manifeſted in his agony and bloody ſweat, than in his ſuffering of reproaches and buffettings: His love and devotion toward God, was full at all times, and did not admit of degrees: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as it is ſaid, <hi>Luke</hi> 22.44. <hi>he prayed,</hi> 
                  <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, <hi>more earneſtly:</hi> and therefore it might appear,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:42750:24"/> he was more ſervent in his devotion and religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous affection, at one time than at another. I anſwer, 1. Some render it <hi>prolixius,</hi> he prayed longer, which did proceed from a deeper im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of his ſufferings upon his ſpirit; but his love and devotion toward God, was ſtill equally intenſe in his ſoul: For even in godly men, ſhort ejaculations, at one time, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers longer at another time, may proceed from devotion in the heart, equal at both times. 2. Though he prayed more earneſtly, yet this earneſtneſs, was not in reſpect of his devotion toward God, unto whom he prayed, whom Chriſt, as man, loved fully and perfectly at all times: but this greater earneſtneſs, was in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the great and inexpreſſible ſufferings againſt which he prayed, being in an agony, and under the ſenſe of greater inward pains, than any he had felt formerly. This manner of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, will not infer any intenſeneſs of his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion and love to God, but only that there was an intenſeneſs of pain and agony in his ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit from what he ſuffered, and againſt which he prayed, yet alwayes with ſubmiſſion to the will of the Father.</p>

<pb n="32" facs="tcp:42750:25"/> to decay of grace, in reſpect of degrees, and to intermiſſion in the exerciſe of grace, through their own ſluggiſhneſs: in prayer they have ſometime a great freedom and out-flowing of the Spirit, <hi>Job</hi> 32.13.

<pb n="33" facs="tcp:42750:25"/> after we have once received it; this provokes God to leave us to our own managing of grace received, and we being left to our ſelves, do ſoon and eaſily miſcarry in the exerciſe of grace: <hi>Peter</hi> failed in the exerciſe and confeſſion of faith, after he had been very confident of his own ſtrength, <hi>Matth.</hi> 26.33. he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed the Lord at the voice of a damſel. 2. Exceſſive worldly fears, make our ſaith great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to abate, in reſpect of the degrees of it at one time and another, <hi>Mark</hi> 4.40. 3. Ingra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, when we neglect or forget to praiſe God for his aſſiſtance and help in our former gracious actings, and when we begin to ſacrifice to our own dragg, then it faireth with us in any new occaſion of acting, as with <hi>Samſon,</hi> after his ſtrength had departed from him: We imagine, from former experience of Gods help, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding our unthankfulneſs, that we ſhall be able to act and exerciſe grace, as in former times; but we find, in our ſad experience, that God, to puniſh our ingratitude, doth leave us to our own counſels and miſcarryings in duties, as he did leave <hi>Samſon,</hi> Judg. 16.20. 4. Our inadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance unto the firſt beginnings of a decay in grace, makes us inſenſible untill the decay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come viſible to others, and in end ſenſible to our ſelves; as it was with <hi>Ephraim, Hoſ.</hi> 7.9. <hi>Gray hairs are here and there upon him, yet he knoweth not,</hi> till there was a viſible change upon all the hairs of his head.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> 2. What ſhall be done for preveening a decay in the degrees of grace? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. The exerciſe of the graces and gifts of the Spirit, is a bleſſed mean to preveen ſuch a decay; this mean <hi>Paul</hi> did uſe, <hi>Act</hi> 24.16. and all that are ſtrong in the faith ſhould do the ſame, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Who by reaſon of uſe, have their ſenſes exerciſed to diſcern both good and evil;</hi> becauſe ſluggiſhneſs and careleſneſs to do ſpiritual duties, when God gives occaſion and opportunity, doth make us more and more remiſs, till in end we are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come with a ſpirit of ſlumber. 2. Be not diſcouraged from ſetting about commanded duties, becauſe poſſibly at firſt thou finds not ſuch vigor or quickneſs of ſpirit, as is requiſit: it was ſtrange and ſtrong deluſion in ſome in theſe latter times, that they would not pray to God, till firſt they ſhould find an impulſe of the Spirit for prayer; but, ſhould not the precept of God, commanding the duty, be ſufficient for moving us to endeavour after it? Were it not a folly in a weak ſick perſon, that had little or no appetite to meat, to reſolve he would forbear to eat, untill he ſhould get ſharpneſs of appetite? ſuch forbearing were the ready way to make him loſe all appetite, and in end his life: but as eating little and little brings for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appetite, ſo thy doing duty from conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to Gods Commandments, brings forward and increaſes thy deſire to ſpiritual duties, and in end, procures thy delight in them. Have
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:42750:26"/> not the children of God, many times at the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of prayer, been ſad and heartleſs, and yet before they have ended (as the countenance of our bleſſed Lord was changed in prayer,) ſo their hearts and countenances have been chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to joy and cheerfulneſs, as we ſee, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 6. and <hi>Pſ.</hi> 13. by comparing the end of the Pſalm, with the beginning thereof? Therefore, though thou find not ſuch an impulſe and ſtrong motion for the duty as thou would, yet make conſcience of obedience to the holy Commandment, and go about duty, truſting to him who hath promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to bleſs the diligent; and when God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the Commandment, calls thee forth to duty by ſtrong motions upon thy ſpirit, neglect not the call of ſuch invitations, but let thine heart come forward to the duty, leſt otherwiſe thou provoke the Spirit of God both to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw thoſe good motions, and alſo his aſſiſtance, which thou mighteſt have had for doing the duty, if thou hadſt embraced the opportunity, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.1, 2, 3. 3 Obſerve well the beginnings of a decay and fainting in duty, and at firſt, run by prayer to Chriſt for quickening thee to duty, and for preventing a farther decay, as <hi>Peter</hi> did when he began to ſink, notwithſtanding he was in the way of duty, he cryed to Chriſt, and was helped, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.32. 4. Whenever thou enters upon commanded duty, pray for the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance of the Spirit, for without him we can do nothing, <hi>Joh.</hi> 15.5. becauſe, an habit or ſtock
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:42750:27"/> of grace is not ſufficient, without the aſſiſtance of his Spirit, impowering and enabling us to mannage the ſtock of received grace, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.10. <hi>His grace which was beſtowed on me, was not in vain: but I laboured more abundantly then they all; yet not I, but the grace of God which was with me.</hi> As it is not enough, that the Ship be furniſhed with Tacklings and Sails, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs there be a proſperous gale of wind upon the Sails, there is no progreſs.</p>

<pb n="37" facs="tcp:42750:27"/> uprightly. Thus our bleſſed Lord did diſcern Hypocrites and Phariſees, notwithſtanding all their fair outward pretences of gravity in their ſmooth ſpeeches: He did alſo diſcern a true <hi>Nathanael</hi> before he had ſeen him with his bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily eyes, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.48.

               <p>By <hi>the fear of the Lord,</hi> we underſtand all things that concern the ſervice and worſhip of God; as ordinarily in holy Scripture, the fear of the Lord is taken, if we compare <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.13. with <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.10.</p>

                  <hi>Obſerv.</hi> 1. Spiritual diſcretion in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of God, is from the Spirit of God; for it is ſaid, <hi>he ſhall make him,</hi> &amp;c. As the Lord Chriſt, the King of Saints, had that gift in a ſpecial and ſuperexcellent manner from the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God; ſo all his ſubjects in the Church, have in ſome meaſure, the gift of diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing truth and error, good and evil, from the ſame Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14, 15. <hi>The natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs unto him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed:</hi> but he that is ſpiritual, judgeth all things. This is evident by induction,</p>
               <p n="1">1. It is the Spirit of the Lord, which open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth the underſtanding to perceive and diſcern heavenly truths, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.11. <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. <hi>Luk.</hi> 24.44. As it is not enough, that an object

               <p n="1">1. The jealouſies of the ſecular powers of this world, as if the Kingdom of Chriſt within his Church, were not conſiſting with their civil power: <hi>Herod</hi> the King was troubled, when he
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:42750:31"/> heard that the King of the Jews was born, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.3. But our bleſſed Lord ſhews them, they need not be ſo jealous and fearful, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18 36. <hi>My kingdom is not of this world.</hi> It is in it, but not of it, but of men ſeparate from the evil of the world. <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> Tractat. on <hi>John,</hi> ſayeth to the powers on earth, <hi>Venite credendo, &amp; nolite metuere ſaeviendo;</hi> Come to Chriſt by believing, and do not fear by raging againſt the Church. He who giveth an heavenly Kingdom, doth not by his Government in the Church, take away mortal Kingdoms from them; whatever has been the pride, violence and uſurpation of Church-men on the civil Government in divers Ages, it was altogether from their own corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not from the nature of the Kingdom of Chriſt, who clearly teacheth his ſubjects in his ſpiritual Kingdom, to give unto <hi>Ceſar</hi> that which is <hi>Ceſars,</hi> and to God, that which is Gods, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.21. Our bleſſed Lord and King of Saints teacheth them, not only ſubjection and ſubordination at all times to lawful Authority, but alſo obedience to all their lawful com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.1. and forbids them to uſe their Chriſtian liberty, as a cloak of maliciouſneſs againſt lawful Authority, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.16.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This Doctrine ſerveth to correct the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments of the ſpiritual Guides at any time upon the civil Authority; as was that of Pope <hi>Gregory</hi> the 7th, becauſe <hi>Henry</hi> 4th the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror, would not come to a ſynodical Anſwer
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:42750:32"/> for his inveſtiture of Church-men in Eccleſia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical Dignities: For this cauſe did the Pope excommunicate him, abſolve the Subjects from their Allegeance, ſtirred them up to rebellion, and in end, gave the Imperial Crown to <hi>Rodolph</hi> Duke of <hi>Swabland.</hi> Pope <hi>Alexander</hi> the third, did inſolently inſult and trample upon the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror <hi>Fredericus Barbaroſſa,</hi> and blaſphemouſly, to his wicked purpoſe, abuſed that place of holy Scripture, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 91.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt tread upon the Lyon,</hi> &amp;c. This is not to be quick and active in the fear of the Lord, as our bleſſed Lord was; but in the pride and violence of their own ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes: How far is ſuch inſolent uſurpation from the precept and practice of Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and alſo from the humble ſubjection of the primitive Chriſtians unto lawful powers? How diſadvantagious ſuch pride and violence has proven unto the advancement of the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, and propagation of the Chriſtian Religion, ſad experience has made it evident, both in former and latter Generations: Such violent dealing has made many men become ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther open enemies to all true Religion, or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites, and ſecret bitter enemies, waiting for a time of revenge. Devout <hi>Bernard,</hi> his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice to Pope <hi>Eugenius</hi> 4th. was, <q>Seing thou art appointed to be a planter in Chriſts Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard, know that thou has need of the Dible, and not of the Scepter: If thou be content with Chriſts Legacy, (to wit) <hi>Feed my ſheep,</hi>
                     <pb n="47" facs="tcp:42750:32"/> thou ſhalt not inherit glory and pomp, but care and labour.</q>
               </p>
               <p>It ſerveth to curb the inconſiderat zeal of too many, who would have this Kingdom to be propagat by force of armes; they conſider not that it is ſpiritual about Religion and the fear of the Lord, and ſuitably to be enlarged by ſpiritual means and midſes; ſuch as are eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the preaching of the Word, <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.19. frequent and fervent prayer to God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.1. a Goſpel-like converſation, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.1. and patient, ſuffering perſecution for the truth, without tumult or ſedition, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 1 29. <hi>Revel.</hi> 13.10. Therefore it was a bold and arrogant ſpeech of <hi>Neſtorius</hi> unto <hi>Theodoſius</hi> the younger, <q>Give thou to me, O Emperor, the earth purged from hereticks, and I ſhall give unto thee heaven; ſcatter thou the hereticks, and I ſhall with thee ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Perſians thy enemies.</q> Theſe ſpeeches became not a Church-man, whoſe weapons are not carnal, but ſpiritual; our bleſſed Lord, though he had power and might, would not command fire to deſtroy the Samaritans, who refuſed to receive him into their City, <hi>Luk.</hi> 9.55, 56.</p>

It was well ſpoken by the Heathen Judge <hi>Ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtides,</hi> fitting in Judgement; when one of the Competitors, pleading before him, ſaid, <q>This fellow hath alſo done great wrong to thy ſelf in ſpeaking evil of thee:</q> My friend (ſaid <hi>Ariſtides</hi>) <q>I pray thee, tell me only the wrong he hath done unto thee, for I am Judge here to do right unto thee, and not to judge the perſonal wrongs done to my ſelf.</q> Raſhneſs in Judgement doth bring guiltineſs upon the Judge, and dammage upon the innocent Party: <hi>David</hi> his raſh Judgement againſt <hi>Mephiboſheth,</hi> did no ſmall prejudice

               <p>We have a memorable example of the power of the Word, recorded by <hi>Cyrill,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Alexandria,</hi> an eye-witneſs of the ſame. <q>At the firſt Council of <hi>Nice</hi> (ſaith he) there came out of curioſity thither an Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſoph, who was a ſubtile and acute Logician, but a great adverſary to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Religion: ſome of the learned Fathers there, reaſoned with him by way of School-diſputes, but he by one or other diſtinction did elude the force of their Arguments: whereupon one of the moſt ſimple in that fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Council, being a very pious, though not a learned man, came againſt him like <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> againſt <hi>Goliah;</hi> and in great ſimplicity of words, with much zeal, ſaith to him, <hi>O Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, in the Name of Jeſus Chriſt hearken

                  </q> 
                  <hi>there is one God, who made Heaven and Earth, who made man of the earth, and breathed life into him; who created all things viſible and inviſible by the power of his Word, and upholds all things by the ſame: this</hi> Word <hi>and Wiſdom, which we call the</hi> Son of God, <hi>having pity on man in his loſt condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, was born of a Virgin, and by his ſuffering of death, hath delivered us from eternal death; by his reſurrection he applyes to us eternal life, and we look for him to come and to judge us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the things done in the body: O Philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pher, believeſt thou it to be ſo?</hi> Then he without all contradiction, as aſtoniſhed with the power of the Word, could only anſwer this, <hi>that it was a truth indeed which he had ſpoken.</hi> Thereafter the aged Father deſired him to follow after himſelf, and to receive Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an an Baptiſm, the ſeal of his faith into that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truth: whereupon he immediatly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, and turning himſelf toward his Schol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, that came along with him, and to the other hearers, ſaid, <hi>So long as men did deal with me by bare words only, I did oppoſe words to words, and by artifice of words I did elude what they ſpoke; but when power came forth from the mouth of the ſpeaker, my naked words could not reſiſt divine power, neither could man withſtand God; and therefore</hi> (ſaith he to his Schollars) <hi>believe ye in Chriſt, and together with me follow this aged man, in and by whom

Their own unbelief: although they have, yet they lay not the threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings to heart, but put the evil day far from them: As the hammer breaks not the hard ſtone, except it be laid to it with ſome force; the old world laid not to heart the threatning

Therefore, as ye would be convinced of the evil and danger of ſin, by the Word of God, and by his ſevere threatnings, lay them to heart by believing: Humble your ſelves under the mighty hand of God; forſake the love of ſin though never ſo gainful or pleaſant; and forſake all communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and fellowſhip with the workers of iniquity in their works of darkneſs.</p>

How ſhall we diſcern the ſmiting of our heart by the Word to be from mercy, and from a purpoſe to heal the ſoul wounded and pierced with ſorrow and fear? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. A wicked and reprobat perſon may be heart-ſmitten with grief and fear for ſome great and hainous ſins, whereof they are convinced not only by the light of the Word, but alſo by the light and ſorce of a natural conſcience, as was <hi>Cain</hi> and <hi>Judas:</hi> Yea, the morning light is to the adulterer, even as the ſhadow of death, <hi>Job</hi> 24.17. but the children of God their heart will ſmite them, even for ſmaller offences: <hi>Davids</hi> heart ſmote him for the cutting of <hi>Sauls</hi> garment; and <hi>Paul</hi> is convinced, not only that his perſecution of the Saints was a ſin, but alſo that his inordinat concupiſcence, and its firſt ſtirrings, was a tranſgreſſion of the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.7. 2. In wicked and obſtinat ſinners, the pain of heart-ſmiting laſteth not, but as a Sea-ſickneſs, it evaniſheth in a ſhort time, and is forgot, as in <hi>Pharaoh, Exod.</hi> 9.27. But it is not ſo in the children of God; though their pain and remorſe of conſcience, continues not al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes in a ſenſe of preſent grief and pain, yet it remains in their memory: they remember the gall and wormwood; and in the remembrance thereof, their heart is kept humble, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 38.17. <hi>I am ready to halt, and my ſorrow is continually

The wicked and obſtinat ſinners, when they are ſmitten with the word of reproof, do hate him who reproves in the gate, as <hi>Ahab</hi> did <hi>Elijah:</hi> but the godly take well with the word of reproof, as with a preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ointment, that makes them afterward to ſhine in their converſation, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 141.5. 4. Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked men, who continue obſtinat in their ſins, make no good uſe of their former heart-ſmite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and pain of conſcience: like ſome men, having at a time a great pain in their ſtomack and head from former exceſs in drinking, make not good uſe thereof, to ſhun the occaſion of exceſs and riot in time coming: but the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God make better uſe of heart-ſmiting, when they are again tempted to run in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of riot, they remember their former diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers, and conſider the peace they have in their conſcience for the preſent, and do make good uſe of that admonition given by our Lord, <hi>Joh</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold thou art made whole, ſin no more, leſt a worſe thing befall thee.</hi>

It is as the lopping of a luxuriant branch, it doth the tree no evil, but makes it more fruitful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.6. <hi>Faithful are the wounds of a friend.</hi> It is a fearful thing to deſpiſe the word of reproof in the mouth of thoſe who have a calling from God: for in that caſe, God many times takes the rod into his own imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat hand, and ſmites the obſtinat ſinner ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely and viſibly, as he did the old world, who contemned the reproof of <hi>Noah;</hi> as he did <hi>Sodom,</hi> who contemned the reproof of <hi>Lot;</hi> as he did <hi>Amaziah,</hi> who rejected the counſel of the Prophet, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 25.16. as he did ſevere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly puniſh the people of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who deſpiſed the counſel of the Prophets, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 36.16. and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> who perſecuted the Prophets that ſpake unto them, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. Therefore the faithful Miniſters of God, muſt not deſiſt from their ſeaſonable reprovings; though poſſibly at firſt they be not well received, yet afterward with the true children of God, they ſhall be entertained as Medicaments for their recovery, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.23. <hi>He that rebuketh a man, after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ſhall find more favour, then he that flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereth with the tongue.</hi>

               <p>IN theſe words is ſet down that great and neceſſary qualification, required for right governing of people, to wit, <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> and <hi>faithfulneſs;</hi> this breeds and entertains great reſpect and confidence in the hearts of the Subjects toward their Governour. The righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and faithfulneſs of Chriſt in governing his Church and people, is evident, eſpecially in theſe four, 1. His veracity and faithfulneſs in all his aſſertions; for he is <hi>the faithful witneſs, Rev.</hi> 1.5. and a faithful witneſs will not lye, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.5. 2. His diligence in doing faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, whatſoever was commanded him of God: it is ſaid, <hi>Heb.</hi> 3.2. <hi>Moſes was faithful in all the houſe of God, making all things according to the pattern ſhown in the mount.</hi> In like manner, our bleſſed Lord was diligent and faithful in
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:42750:49"/> doing all things for the good of his Church, according to the eternal counſel and decree of the Father, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.26. <hi>And I have declared unto them thy Name, and will declare it.</hi> 3. His carefulneſs in keeping all theſe who by ſaith and well-doing commit their ſouls to him: <hi>Jacob</hi> was faithful and careful in keeping the ſheep of <hi>Laban:</hi> Our bleſſed Lord, the great ſhepherd of our ſouls, keepeth all his ſheep who hear his voice, and follow him by obedience, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.40. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10 27, 28. 4.

His readineſs and forwardneſs to perform all his promiſes, as one girded and prepared for his journey: therefore he is ſaid to wait, that he may be gracious, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 30 18. and to ſtand at the door ready to enter in, when it is opened, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.20. 3.

                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. Seing our bleſſed Lord is righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous and faithful in all his aſſertions, though ſome of them may ſeem ſtrange and incredible to ſenſe and humane reaſon, not yet purified and elevated by the light of ſaith; it is our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to captivat ſenſe and humane reaſon unto all his aſſertions, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5, as to believe the unity of his eſſence with the Father, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe he, who is the <hi>faithful witneſs,</hi> hath aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.31. <hi>I and my Father are one:</hi> To believe his eternal exiſtence before all time, even his perſonal pre-exiſtence with the Father, before his coming forth in his Incarnation and aſſuming of the Humane Nature, becauſe he himſelf, who is the <hi>truth</hi> hath aſſerted it, <hi>Pro.</hi> 8.30. <hi>I was by him, as one brought up with him.</hi> He was co-eternal with the Father, and yet in the fulneſs of time came forth from the Father, into this inferiour world, to take on him the vail of fleſh, and thereby conſecrat an entry for us into the moſt holy place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.28. <hi>I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world, Heb.</hi> 10.19, 20. It is our duty to believe his individual operation with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the works of Creation and Providence, not as a cauſe ſocial with the Father, but as one prime cauſe with him, becauſe he himſelf
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:42750:50"/> who is righteous and faithful, hath aſſerted it, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.17, 19, 20. <hi>My Father worketh hitherto and I work,</hi> &amp;c. To believe the reſurrection of the dead upon his own teſtimony full of ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racity, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.28. <hi>The hour is coming, in the which all that are in the graves ſhall hear his voice, and ſhall come forth.</hi> But we are not too curiouſly to enquire about the manner how he will quicken and raiſe the body out of the duſt; we leave that to the unſearchable wiſdom and infinit power of our Lord, who will do it ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the working, whereby he is able, even to ſubdue all things unto himſelf, <hi>Philip.</hi> 3.21. Though we cannot conceive the ſpecial manner, how Original ſin is propagat, yet we aſſent to the truth of the thing it ſelf, upon his teſtimony, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.6. <hi>That which is born of the fleſh, is fleſh.</hi> And, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.17, 18. <hi>By the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of one, judgement came upon all men to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaith well, <q>We ſhould not ſo much enquire about the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner how Original concupiſcence hath entred into us, which we feel in our ſelves, by daily experience, as about the manner how it may be extinguiſhed.</q> And, <hi>Lib.</hi> 2. <hi>de Nup. &amp; Concupiſ.

Cap.</hi> 21. <q>Nothing is more notour, than that ſin is propagat from the parents to the children: but nothing is more obſcure, than the manner how it is propagat:</q> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſaith he elſewhere, <q>In humane truths, <hi>intelligam ut credam,</hi> let me underſtand the matter that I may believe: but in divine truths, <hi>credam ut intelligam,</hi> let me believe that God hath ſpoken it, and then I ſhall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it to be a moſt certain and irrefra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable truth.</q> That ye may be the more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in this Doctrine, which giveth glory to the truth and faithfulneſs of Jeſus Chriſt againſt unreaſonable men (though they call themſelves moſt rational) pleading from humane reaſon to the weakening of the teſtimony of God, which is the ſupreme reaſon. Conſider, 1. It is againſt all ſound reaſon to meaſure the infinit <hi>Being,</hi> and his operations with the ſame rule of humane reaſon and Philoſophy, by which we meaſure finit beings and their operations: Were it not an abſurd ſolly to meaſure a tall man with the ſame meaſure we meaſure an infant; this were as the binding of <hi>Samſon</hi> with cords of flax. 2. Yea it is moſt agreeable to ſound reaſon, that moſt credit and faith ſhould be given un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſupreme <hi>reaſon,</hi> to wit, the teſtimony of God, who is the prime verity: for the more famous the perſon teſtifying be, we eſteem the
<pb n="84" facs="tcp:42750:51"/> more of his teſtimony. 3. We believe ſome natural truths, from our own ſenſe and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, though we cannot give a natural and evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent reaſon of our knowledge of ſuch things; as of the ebbing and flowing of the Sea; of the influence of the Planets upon the inferiour and ſublunary Bodies; of the attractive vertue of the Adamant or Load-ſtone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And is not the teſtimony of God a more ſure ground for faith to reſt on, than our own experience and ſenſe, which many times may be, and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is ſubject to miſtakes? That one paſſage (<hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.5.) is ſufficient to ſtop our curioſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and to make us acquieſce without gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaying, to the teſtimony of God, <hi>As thou know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt not what is the way of the Spirit, nor how the bones do grow in the womb of her that is with child; even ſo thou knoweſt not the works of God, who maketh all.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ</hi> 2. From our bleſſed Lord his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs and diligence in doing the duties of his Mediatory-office, whereunto he was called by the Father, we have a fair pattern and copy for our inſtruction and imitation to be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent in our lawful Callings: His mind and his time was all taken up in his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and diligent diſcharge of the Office of Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, committed to him by the Father, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.49. <hi>Wiſt ye not that I muſt be about my Fathers buſineſs?</hi> And for the better up ſtirring of you to follow his example in your lawful Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings
<pb n="85" facs="tcp:42750:51"/> and Employments, Conſider, 1. God bleſſeth the diligent and faithful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 28.20. but he that is diligent, or rather fool-haſty in uſing unlawful means, and ſo having no calling to that effect from God, cannot expect a bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, <hi>Prov.</hi> 22.29. <hi>But he that maketh haſte to to be rich, ſhall not be innocent.</hi> 2. Zeal in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and ſpiritual duties, doth well conſiſt with diligence in our lawful employments, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.11. <hi>Not ſlothful in buſineſs, fervent in ſpirit, ſerving the Lord.</hi> Yea this fidelity and diligence in our particular Callings, doth adorn our Chriſtian profeſſion, but unfaithfulneſs and negligence is the reproach of it, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.9, 10. 3. Idleneſs is a breach of the eighth Command, <hi>Thou ſhalt not ſteal,</hi> as is evident, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.28. Becauſe the ſluggard ſtealeth away much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous time from the right uſe of it. As theft is an uſurpation of that which belongs to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo the ſlothful man eats his bread with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any allowance or bleſſing from God, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.10. 4. The ſlothful man is a waſter of much precious time, and a great impediment to himſelf in what he might have had, if he had been diligent, <hi>Prov.</hi> 18.9. <hi>He alſo that is ſloth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in his work, is brother to him that is a great waſter.</hi> 5. Idleneſs and ſlothfulneſs is a great in-let to that evil one, and to many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons with him: The unclean ſpirit entred into the empty houſe with a train of other evil ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, <hi>Mat.</hi> 12.42. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid truly, <hi>Men by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="86" facs="tcp:42750:52"/> nothing, learn to do evil:</hi> And the Heathen Poet could ſay, <hi>Otia ſi tollas,</hi> &amp;c. Take away idleneſs, ſo ſhall you take away the fewel of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny noiſome luſts.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 3. From his faithfulneſs and care in keeping what is committed to his truſt, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred our duty: 1. Every one to be faithful in their truſt, in imitation of him, who was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in keeping all who were committed to his truſt by the Father: eſpecially men in publick places, as Magiſtrates, to whoſe truſt God hath committed his people, as <hi>Pupils</hi> to their Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors; and there is a day coming, wherein the ſupreme Lord, and everlaſting Father, will call them to make their Tutors-accounts: there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould be faithful, careful, and tender Nurſing-fathers, to protect them by their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: but no wayes by oppreſſion or ſubtilty to prey upon the ſimplicity and weakneſs of their Pupils: Likewiſe the Spiritual Guides in the Church, ſhould learn from him, who was faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in all the houſe of God, to diſpenſe the bread of life faithfully to the children of God, as theſe who are Stewards of the myſteries of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.1. and muſt give an account to God for the ſouls committed to their truſt, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.17. And as men in publick places would be faithful, they ſhould labour for a deep impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the fear of God upon their ſpirits, 2 <hi>Chr.</hi> 19.9. <hi>Neh.</hi> 5.15. 2. Let us take comfort from his faithfulneſs and care to keep what is
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:42750:52"/> committed to him; let us caſt all our care on him, who careth for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.28.</p>
               <p>Our ſpiritual enemies can never get advantage from any negligence in him; for he is the watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that neither ſleeps nor ſlumbers; nor from any weakneſs in him, for he is the ſtronger one, and the Almighty one, <hi>Rev.</hi> 1.8. he is both able to keep that which is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him, <hi>Jude</hi> Epiſt. 24. and alſo willing, <hi>John</hi> 6.37. It is the will of God and our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to uſe all means and endeavours for keeping our ſelves in the love and fear of God, 1 <hi>John</hi> 5.18. <hi>Jude</hi> Epiſt. 20. but let us not truſt to our own keeping, but pray to the Lord that he would keep us in the hour of temptation, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 16.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 26.41. remembering alwayes, that we are kept by his power through faith, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.5.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. From the faithfulneſs of our bleſſed Lord, in keeping and performing all his precious and gracious promiſes, let us learn, 1. for our imitation, to be faithful in that ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn promiſe made to God in our baptiſm; becauſe in baptiſm we were conſecrate to God, and by profeſſion put on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.27. Therefore, when we call to mind that ſolemn engagement, we ſhould be faithfull to keep that promiſe; and ſhould not make proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. As it is ſacriledge to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriat that which has been dedicat unto pious
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:42750:53"/> uſes; So it is moſt deteſtable ſacriledge to with-draw our ſelves from ſerving God in holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and righteouſneſs, unto the fulfilling of our own ſinful luſts. How many promiſes of amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of life have we made unto God in the day of our affliction? Let us be faithful, and pay the vows which our lips have uttered, when we were in trouble, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 66.13, 14. Let us be faithful in performing our lawful promiſes made by one to another; and truly a man fearing God will make conſcience of ſincerity in mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a lawful promiſe, and of honeſt endeavours in performing, unleſs God in his providence render it impoſſible, <hi>Gen.</hi> 42.18. <hi>This do and live, for I fear God.</hi> But the deceitful and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faithful man, that in promiſing has no purpoſe to perform, is like unto <hi>Antigonus</hi> King of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedon,</hi> who made many large promiſes to give this and that to ſome men, but gave it not; therefore in reproach he was called <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>, one that was ever to give, but never gave what he had promiſed.</p>
               <p>From our bleſſed Lord his faithfulneſs for performing all his gracious promiſes, we have a ſolid ground for concluding aſſurance of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort unto all Expectants of glory, and eternal reſt in heaven, who are now in a ſtate of grace and ſanctification. As our bleſſed Lord is faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in revealing the will of the Father, ſo is he likewayes in performing all the promiſes of God, which in him are <hi>yea</hi> and <hi>amen,</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.20.
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:42750:53"/> He will give in his own good time that reſt and ſatisfaction promiſed to all who are preſſed and wearied with the burden of their ſins, <hi>Mat.</hi> 11.28 He will cleanſe the true penitents, who confeſs their ſins with a ſerious purpoſe and endeavour to forſake them, 1 <hi>John</hi> 1.9. he will give ſtrength to all who are humbled under the ſenſe of their own weakneſs, and truſt to him for help, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to his faithful promiſe, <hi>Job</hi> 23.6. <hi>Iſ.</hi> 42.2. and he will give the promiſed outgate unto all who are patient and long-ſuffering under great and continued tryals, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.13.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Object.</hi> 1. It is true, he is faithful in all his promiſes, but I doubt the promiſes are made to me; for there is no mention made of me in all the gracious promiſes. <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. In ſpeaking thus, thou ſpeakeſt againſt the generation of the juſt, as if there were not a gracious promiſe made to any living in thy generation, for there is no mention of them in particular, more than of thy ſelf. 2. If thou be weary of ſin, the promiſe of reſt is made unto thee; for it is made to all who are weary of ſin, and by faith come to Chriſt, the precious corner-ſtone laid in <hi>Zion,</hi> for reſt and ſupport to wearied ſinners, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 28.16. If thou mourn for ſin, and by faith in Chriſt come unto God for comfort, thou mayeſt be aſſured, the promiſe of comfort is made unto thee. If thou thirſt after Chriſt and his righteouſneſs, the promiſe of ſatisfaction and refreſhment is made to thee: Therefore, although thou ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge
<pb n="90" facs="tcp:42750:54"/> thine own unworthineſs, as juſtly thou mayeſt, yet acknowledge alſo his faithful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 69.32. <hi>Your heart ſhall live that ſeek God.</hi> Iſa. 45.19. <hi>I ſaid not unto the ſeed of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob, ſeek ye me in vain; I the Lord ſpeak righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs.</hi> In this caſe do thou as wiſe <hi>Abigail,</hi> who acknowledged her ſelf unworthy of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vids</hi> gracious offer and meſſage ſent unto her; yet ſhe went after the meſſengers of <hi>David,</hi> and became his wife, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.41, 42. In like manner, obey thou his gracious meſſage and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer of reſt and ſatisfaction, proponed to thee by his Miniſters in the preaching of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, and let thy heart co-habit with him.</p>
               <p>

A change from the better to beſt of all, from an eſtate of grace here, unto an eſtate of immortal glory at our death, <hi>Job</hi> 14.14. <hi>All the dayes of my appointed time, will I wait till my change come.</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.51. <hi>We ſhall not all ſleep, but we ſhall all be changed.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſid.</hi> 2. What man loſt by his firſt change, and what he loſt not: he loſt not through his fall any thing, which was eſſential to him; for then after his fall he ſhould have been no more a man, although after his fall he is ſometimes called in holy Scripture a beaſt; yet not that he became ſuch in nature, but becauſe he was carried for the moſt part like a brute beaſt by ſenſe, toward that which was pleaſant to fleſh and bloud: he retained ſtill after the fall his natural faculties of underſtanding and will: he had an inbred capacity to underſtand ſome ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative truths, as that there is a God; and that the whole is more than any ſeveral part of the ſame: and alſo to underſtand practical truths,
<pb n="105" facs="tcp:42750:61"/> 
                  <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. as, that he is to be worſhipped, and that we ſhould do to others as we would have them do to us. He loſt not his liberty of will, in willing freely from previous deliberation, without coaction, or force in the proper and elicit acts of the will, in willing or refuſing; though in the outward man he may be forced, yet can he not be forced in his will: when a man is forced to go into priſon, yet his will is not forced, for ſtill he freely willeth it not. He loſt not the affections of grief at what was noiſome, nor of fear at what might harm him; he had them in the ſtate of innocency in the firſt act, and proneneſs (as they ſpeak) but not in the act of exerciſe, till after his fall into miſery; theſe affections were loſt in reſpect of their ſtraightneſs and rectitude, but not in reſpect of their ſubſtance and being. Man by his fall loſt not the faculty of conſcience; for after his fall, conſcience made him aſhamed of his naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and the natural conſcience in Heathen men, is ſaid to accuſe or excuſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.15. He loſt not the ſhape or poſture of his body, whereby he is in ſome ſort diſtinguiſhed from all other creatures: I grant, accidental defor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities in the body, are the conſequents of ſin; but yet the frame of it, in reſpect of the ſcitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the members, was not loſt. He loſt not dominion altogether over the creatures: although wicked and unregenerat men have not a right to the creatures, as they are pledges
<pb n="106" facs="tcp:42750:62"/> of a better portion in Heaven; yet they have ſtill a right to the bare creature, but without that relation to that better portion in the other life. For, as wicked men have their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural life from God, ſo they have a right and allowance from God to preſerve that life, by the uſe and help of his good creatures; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it were not lawful for them to uſe means for preſerving their life, but they ſhould rather abſtain from them.</p>
               <p>By his fall, he loſt clearneſs and quickneſs of underſtanding, to take up and diſcern heavenly and ſpiritual truths, in order to the ſalvation of his own ſoul, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. Although he loſt not the faculty of willing, nor liberty from coaction, and from a natural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination to this or that; yet he loſt the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of rectitude and uprightneſs, by being now after his fall perverſly inclined to that which is diſpleaſing in the eyes of God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.10. We are called enemies to God by na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and enmity is properly in the will. He loſt purity in his affections; our affections, at firſt, were like clean and pure water running in a clean channel, but now they are muddy and earthly, there being much perturbation in them, like water running through a muddy channel, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.31. <hi>He that is of the earth, is earthly.</hi> Our affections at firſt were ſtraight, ſet upon God and things above; but now they are bowed down, and through the ſtrength of
<pb n="107" facs="tcp:42750:62"/> corrupt nature, ſet on things below, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.5: <hi>For they that are after the fleſh, do mind the things of the fleſh.</hi> Although fallen man hath not loſt the faculty of conſcience, yet he hath loſt that clearneſs, quietneſs and calmneſs that was in it at the firſt: for ſo long as man lived in a communion and harmony with God, there was alſo inward peace, and a pleaſant harmony in his conſcience, like an inſtrument well tuned: but when by ſin he brake harmony and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with God, then his conſcience became like a troubled ſea, roaring out into his ears a dreadful ſound from fear of wrath to come, as a mighty tempeſt to drive them into hell; then as Out-laws, they were afraid at every thing: So <hi>Adam</hi> and <hi>Eva,</hi> after the fall, had a mighty tempeſt in their conſciences, which did drive them away to hide themſelves from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider.</hi> 3. In converſion to an eſtate of grace, there is a happy change, 1. In the mind, by illumination and light: as at firſt God cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated light in the firſt creation, ſo in the ſecond creation and regeneration, he firſt creats the light of faith, whereby we ſee God reconciled to man in Chriſt the Mediator, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>God who commanded the light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> When a man is converted, he gets a new light, in reſpect of his mind, which is the
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:42750:63"/> ſubject of it: but it is not a new light in reſpect of the object; he hath not new ſpiritual and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving truths revealed to him, beſide, or far leſs contrary to the Word: as a blind man, when his eyes are opened, doth not ſee another Sun, then what was before in the firmament, though not ſeen by him, until his eyes were opened. 2. God makes a change in the will, by taking away the ſtony heart, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.14. He removes impenitence and unbelief, which are as two ſtrong barrs to reſiſt his call by the outward means, until he remove them by the power of his invincible grace, whereby he worketh mightily in thoſe that believe, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19. For not only doth he preach deliverance by his Word, but alſo he ſets at liberty ſuch as are bruiſed with ſorrow in their hearts for their ſins, <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.18. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.17. <hi>Where the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Lord is, there is liberty. Auguſt. (Lib.</hi> 1. againſt the 2 <hi>Epiſt.</hi> of <hi>Pelag. Cap.</hi> 19. citing that place, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.44. <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father draw him,</hi>) obſerves, it is not ſaid, no man can come to me except the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lead him, that ſo we might think the will of man did preceed, and thereafter the Father did lead and promove his will: but it is ſaid, <hi>except the Father draw him:</hi> and who can be ſaid to be drawn, if he himſelf firſt be willing? therefore (ſaith he) they are made in a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful manner, even to be willing by him, who knoweth how to work inwardly upon the hearts
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:42750:63"/> of men: not that any man (for that is impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible) ſhould believe againſt his will, but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe of not-willing, he is made willing. 3. There is a change in their affections, which in ſome meaſure are purified and rectified: the ſenſe of Gods love in Chriſt worketh godly ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in their hearts, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. It works a filial fear in them, to do any thing that may of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend God, <hi>Jer.</hi> 32.40. <hi>I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> 4. There is a change in the conſcience, after converſion, it is quiet and calm: the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of Chriſt apprehended by a lively ſaith, doth quiet the conſcience, both with the peace of Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.1. <hi>Being juſtified by faith, we have peace with God, through our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And with the peace of Sanctifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, <hi>Rom.</hi> 14.17. <hi>The kingdom of God is not meat and drink, but righteouſneſs and peace, and joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> The conſcience after con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, becomes more tender of duty, and ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, even of ſmaller offences, like the fleſh of <hi>Naaman,</hi> cleanſed from his leproſie: ſuch ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs we ſee in <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.113. <hi>I hate vain thoughts, but thy Law do I love.</hi> 5. There is a change in the body and converſation: the body, it becomes a temple to the Holy Ghoſt, and all its members, like ſeveral Veſſels in the Temple, are conſecrat to the ſervice of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.19. <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.19.</p>
               <pb n="110" facs="tcp:42750:64"/>
               <p>
                  <hi>Conſider.</hi> 4. This change is not perfect in degrees, 1. Our knowledge in the ſtate of grace here is but in part, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.9. <hi>For we know in part.</hi> In many myſteries of Religion, we know, that ſuch a thing is an undoubted truth from divine revelation; but the cauſe and manner how ſuch and ſuch things are, we know not; as the eternal generation of the Son; the manner of the eternal proceſſion of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Ghoſt from the Father and the Son, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual unity of the three bleſſed Perſons in the Divine Eſſence; theſe myſteries we know in a confuſed and general manner, like the ſight of the blind man of <hi>Bethſaida, Mark</hi> 8.24. But in Heaven our knowledge of theſe great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, will be more clear, like the ſight of that ſame blind man by a ſecond touch, and by the light of glory; when we ſhall ſee light in his light, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 36.9. and when we ſhall ſee him as he is, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.2. 2. Although there be a change of our will at our converſion, yet there remains in it corruption, which is the ſeed of diſobedience to the will of God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.17. <hi>The fleſh luſteth againſt the ſpirit.</hi> This tumult and inſurrection of corruption againſt grace in the will, doth pain and vex the godly, like the twains which ſtrove in the womb of <hi>Rebekah:</hi> but after our change at death to immortal glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, our petition put up to God in this life, ſhall be fully anſwered, <hi>Thy will be done on earth, as it is done in heaven:</hi> then ſhall we be like un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42750:64"/> Angels, and our will ſhall cleave unto God and his will indeclinably for ever. 3. Our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, after our change and converſion in this life, are not wholly pure; who can ſay he hath made his heart clean? <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.9. As ſhoes open above (as was the manner of the Jewiſh Nation in our bleſſed Lord his time) did con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract duſt and fuilȝie, and their feet had need of daily waſhing, ſo our affections are not ſo cloſly united to God; but many times they are open and enlarged toward the world, which defiles the heart, and puts even men converted unto a daily neceſſity of repentance, and cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from all uncleanneſs of the fleſh and the ſpirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. But in Heaven there will be perfect purity of heart, like Angels; not a wandering motion there; we will be far above the world which defiles the heart, and far above the vain ſhadows of this preſent world, which now and then interveening, draws our eye and heart off God: but at our change into glory, nothing can or will interveen between God and us; our minds and our hearts then will be wholly and unchangeably ſet upon him. 4. Though now after converſion, there may be ſome calmneſs in the conſcience, yet it continues not alwayes alike; ſome of the godly do ſay, as <hi>Job</hi> 7.4. <hi>I am full of toſſing to and fro;</hi> as <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 42.7. <hi>All thy waves and thy billows have gone over me:</hi> and as <hi>Hezekiah, Iſ.</hi> 38.13. <hi>As a lyon, ſo will he break all my bones,</hi> &amp;c.
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42750:65"/> But at our laſt change to glory in heaven, there will be a perfect and an everlaſting calm; like that of men toſſed at Sea, when they come within a ſafe Harbour; for the ſalvation of God will be a perpetual bullwark unto them. 5. The body of the godly in this life, is ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject many times, as a drudge, unto a corrupt and imperious will; but at our laſt change, as the will of the godly will be wholly and ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubordinat unto the will of God; ſo in the day of reſurrection, the body with all its mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ſhall be a Temple filled with the Holy Ghoſt: then there ſhall not be a wrong look in the eye, nor an impertinent word in the tongue, nor a wrong ſtep in all the courſe of our bodily motion and converſation; the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy now is weak and ſickly, but then it will be ever healthful and ſtrong; now it is weary and ſubject to fainting, but then it will be agile (as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſpeaketh) it will be in an inſtant of time, whereſoever the ſpirit ſhall deſire to be; then ſhall our bodies and tabernacles of clay be conform to the pattern ſhown in the mount, when our bleſſed Lord was transfigured, <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip.</hi> 3.20.</p>
               <p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. For conviction of many, who think they are in a ſtate of grace, when in the mean time, they are carryed away with ſenſe and maſterful paſſions, like brute-beaſts, toward the fulfilling of their ſinful luſts: ſome are like Lyons in fierce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſome like Bears in their inconſiderat wrath,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42750:65"/> ſome like evening Wolves in their cruel cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touſneſs, ſome like the Aſps in the venom of their tongues, and others like the Crocodiles in diſſembling their cruelty with falſe ſhews of pity, that the more eaſily they may deſtroy the ſimple ones; but ſuch men would conſider in time, how far they are from being of the meek Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt; <hi>now if any man have not the ſpirit of Chriſt, he is none of his,</hi> Rom. 8.9.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 2. For exhortation to all ſuch who are yet the old men, like <hi>Moab,</hi> not changed from their Lees; conſider, 1. in Gods accompt ye are compared to Beaſts, before this happy change ſpoken of here be wrought in you; and (as it is truly ſaid) it is better to be a beaſt, than truly compared to a beaſt. 2. Ye can have no evidence that ye are in Chriſt, but from this change; <hi>If any man be in Chriſt, he is a new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> 2 Cor. 5.17. and if any man be not a new creature, he is not yet actually in Chriſt; and it is not poſſible to be with him in glory after this life, except ye be in him firſt as new creatures in this life; for as there is no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation to them that are in him, ſo there is no ſalvation to them that are not in him, who is the Saviour only of his myſtical body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. 3. If there be no change from thy ſtate of corrupt nature; death in its approach will be terrible, like a Serjeant at Armes to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend a rebel in his act of rebellion, and ſtraight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wayes to hale him before the Kings Bench,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42750:66"/> 
                  <hi>Pſal.</hi> 7.12, 13. 4. There is no coming to heaven, without this change; as lepers under the Law, were not admitted into the aſſemblies of the people of God, before they were cleanſed from their leproſie, So there will not be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion into the aſſembly of the firſt-born in heaven, untill you be cleanſed from your ſins; and all your preſumptuous thoughts of ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without cleanſing the heart and converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, are but vain imaginations and groundleſs phantaſies, <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſaved: how long ſhall thy vain thoughts lodge with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in thee?</hi>
               </p>

                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 3. For confort to all ſuch, in whom God by his Word and Spirit has wrought a real change from their former vain and ſinful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: be of good comfort, he who has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun the good work of grace in thy ſoul, will finiſh it untill the day of Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.6. he is the wiſe builder, and will perfect his work of free grace begun in thee in this life: though thy knowledge of God, and of thy happineſs in him be but in part, yet in the other life it will be full, like the light of the Sun at noon-day, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.12. Now thy knowledge is mediat, as through a latteſſe; then ſhall it be imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diat and intuitive, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>we ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> In this ſtate of grace, our will is not only mutable by nature, but alſo of a mutable condition, even after we are in a ſtate of grace,
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42750:66"/> and has a proneneſs and liberty unto evil; but in heaven our will ſhall be of an immutable condition, fixed alwayes upon God, and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinat unto his will neceſſarily, yet moſt freely, without all force and co-action; for then it will be our meat and drink to do the will of our heavenly Father: then there will be perfect purity in the affections, we ſhall be preſented to the Father altogether faultleſs, <hi>Jude</hi> Epiſt. 24. then ſhall there be full joy and everlaſting delight in God himſelf the ſupreme <hi>good.</hi> There will be an everlaſting calm in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, not ſo much as an air of temptation, or whiſper of any inordinat motion; and all the members of the body will be weapons of righteouſneſs, like veſſels in the temple above, wholly conſecrat to God. Therefore, let the children of God in all the outward changes they ſee in this unconſtant world, and in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward changes they feel now and then in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in reſpect of their ſpiritual condition, yet hold faſt their confidence in God, and rejoyce in the hope of that unchangeable condition that abides them in heaven.</p>

Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther muſt we conſult with humane reaſon and Philoſophy, as our dictator in the great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Chriſtian Faith; ſuch as are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual unity of the divine eſſence in the three bleſſed Perſons; the eternal generation of the Son; the proceſſion of the holy Ghoſt from the Father and from the Son; the perſonal union of the divine and humane nature of Chriſt, and the reſurrection of the body in the great day: It is ground enough for us to believe the truth and reality of theſe great and deep Myſteries, that God, who cannot lie, hath revealed them in the holy Word: but we muſt be ſober in our enquiry of the manner; and although we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not, by humane reaſoning, attain to the natural knowledge and ſcience of theſe divine truths; and although, through our infirmity and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, we imagine them to be contrary to Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural and Philoſophical verity; yet, after bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſideration, we conclude, that Superna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42750:77"/> verities, are not contrary to Natural truths; becauſe God, the prime verity, is the Author of all real verity, and he cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict himſelf: only by the light of divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation, and the inward light of Faith, we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and take up theſe ſublime divine myſteries, which we cannot diſcern by the light of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral reaſon, though never ſo refined: as the light of the ſtars, and the light of the Sun, are from God the Creator; and the light of the Sun, is not contrary to the light of the Stars; for both of them, are lightſome bodies: yet we ſee many things by the light of the Sun, to which our eye cannot reach by the light of the ſtars. Therefore let us ſubmit our faith to divine revelation in the Word, and not oppoſe the barkings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane reaſonings againſt revealed truths: It may be well ſaid to theſe men, who Idolize humane reaſon and Philoſophy, which <hi>Tertullian</hi> ſaid of the Hereticks in his time, in his book of the reſurrection of the fleſh, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <q>Take from them theſe things of humane Wiſdom, wherein they agree with the <hi>Heathens;</hi> that ſo they may determine their queſtions from the Scriptures alone; and they cannot ſtand in the debate.</q> It may be juſtly ſaid to them, which <hi>Auguſtine</hi> ſaid to the <hi>Manichees, Lib.</hi> 17. againſt <hi>Fauſt. Chap.</hi> 3. <q>Your tergiverſation and prevarication, is every way confounded: ſay plainly, that ye believe not the Goſpel: for when ye believe in the Goſpel what ye

The more ſilent humane reaſon is in theſe great myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, the obedience of faith is the more conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuous; and it well becomes humane reaſon, that is an hand-maid to Divinity, to be ſilent when her Miſtriſs ſpeaketh. <hi>Auguſtine</hi> frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in his diſputes with the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> who did too much extol the ſtrength of humane reaſon, doth repeat this ſaying, <hi>credam ut intelligam:</hi> Let me once believe it is ſpoken by God, then ſhall I underſtand it to be a truth, evident in reſpect of divine teſtimony, though I ſee no evidence in the things themſelves. <hi>Bernard Epiſt.</hi> 190. <q>What is more againſt reaſon, than to endeavour, by thy low and ſilly humane reaſon, to tranſcend and ſurmount ſupreme reaſon, to wit, the teſtimony of God him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who is the prime verity?</q> 4. As thou would be led by the Miniſtry of the Word, come to the reading and hearing of it with an honeſt heart, that is, with a ſerious and ſincere purpoſe to obey the counſel and direction of it, though it ſhould croſs thy opinion, deſign, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour, or intereſt, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.15. Thou muſt not

For when the meſſage is commended unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience of the hearers, it makes room alſo in the heart for receiving the Meſſenger, for his Maſter's and the works ſake: <hi>Rebekah</hi> was very civil and courteous toward <hi>Abraham</hi>'s ſervant, who came to ſuit her in marriage to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's Son, <hi>Gen.</hi> 24. and ſhall not believers be kindly affectioned toward the Miniſters of the Goſpel, who are friends to the Bridegroom Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, and do ſuit them in marriage unto him? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>I have eſpouſed you to one husband, that I may preſent you, as a chaſt virgin to Chriſt.</hi>

From this evidence of true converſion, we infer clearly theſe two concluſions, 1. Men truly converted, will forſake their former evil ways of purchaſe by fraud or oppreſſion, and will make conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the way of their purchaſe in time com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 2. They will ſtudy contentment in their lawful purchaſe, whether it be great or ſmall.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. As a true Convert will forſake in his purpoſe and endeavour, every former evil way, becauſe he knoweth mercy from God is promiſed only to ſuch, <hi>Prov</hi> 28.13. <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth and forſaketh his ſins, ſhall have mercy.</hi> Iſai. 55.7. <hi>Let the wicked forſake his way, and the unrighteous man his thoughts, and let him return unto the Lord, and he will have mercy upon him, and to our God, for he will abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pardon.</hi> So the man, that hath been an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſour or fraudulent in his dealings and bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gains with others, will forſake theſe former evil ways, and make conſcience of lawful pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42750:79"/> in time coming: this was manifeſtly ſeen in <hi>Zacheus,</hi> who before his converſion was an extortioner, and exactor of more than was due; but after his converſion, he reſtored four fold, and made conſcience of his purchaſe in all time coming, <hi>Luke</hi> 19.8. The reaſons why true Converts do ſo, are, 1. Becauſe ſuch men know, that as they ſhould walk humbly with God, ſo they ſhould walk honeſtly and juſtly with men, <hi>Mic.</hi> 6.8. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.3, 6. <hi>This is the will of God, that no man go beyond, and defraud his brother in any matter.</hi> 2. They know that God threatens ſevere judgements againſt extortioners and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauders, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.10. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.6. 3. They know that faithfulneſs and uprightneſs, in our particular Callings and Employments, doth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn their holy profeſſion, and ſtops the mouths of ſuch as are adverſaries to it, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.15. <hi>For ſo is the will of God, that with well-doing ye may put to ſilence the ignorance of fooliſh men.</hi> And they know alſo, that unrighteouſneſs in our particular ſtations and employments, doth open the mouths of adverſaries, to ſpeak evil of our profeſſion; thereby profane men within the viſible Church, are hardened in their ſinful practices, and they ſay, Why may not they do as ſuch and ſuch great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors do? Thereby men without the Church viſible, are hardened in their errour and alie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of heart, from a communion with the Chriſtian Church: therefore <hi>Auguſtine</hi> unto
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:42750:79"/> this queſtion well anſwereth, if it be lawful to a Chriſtian to ſpoil and rob a Jew, who is an obſtinat adverſary to the Chriſtian Religion? he anſwers, <q>It is no way lawful; becauſe thou who art a Chriſtian, by ſo doing, hardens the Jew in his errour and infidelity, and hinders him to become a Chriſtian.</q> Therefore it is our duty to walk in wiſdom and uprightneſs toward them that are without the Chriſtian Church, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5. remembring alwayes, the ſecond Table of the Divine Law, is the ſure Teſt, according to which is tried the ſincerity of men in the duties of the firſt Table, <hi>Luk:</hi> 18.19, 20. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.35. <hi>He that feareth God, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted of God.</hi> Such was the practice of ſincere Converts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in holy Scripture: <hi>Simeon</hi> was juſt and devout, <hi>Luke</hi> 2.25.

Unlawful purchaſe makes a man un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, and afraid to die; as a thief, taken with the ſang, is unwilling and afraid to come before the juſt Judge: the unrighteous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſer cannot leave his evil-gotten goods with any confidence of a bleſſing upon them from God to his children and heirs: for he may know from the very light of nature, that the righteous Judge of all the earth, doth not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the malefactors evil deeds: yea, though the children ſhould prove good and upright men, not walking in the ways of their father; yet they being poſſeſſors of his evil-gotten goods, are <hi>in mala fide</hi> unjuſt uſurpers; and the righteous Lord and Judge of all the earth, doth oftentimes puniſh them, or rather the memory of the unrighteous purchaſer their Progenitor, by taking the curſed thing out of their poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

A ſincere Convert is content with any little portion purchaſed with a good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience: he is like the Ox well ſatisfied in eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtraw, that groweth from his own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Job</hi> 6.5. <hi>Doth the wild Aſs bray when he hath graſs? or loweth the Ox over his fodder?</hi> For the better underſtanding this point, we would know, 1. What true contentment is. 2. The grounds of it. 3. And the way how to attain it.</p>
               <p>True contentment is a voluntar and quiet ſatisfaction to the ſoul in our preſent conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, from a chearful ſubmiſſion to the will of God, who in his wiſe providence meaſureth out our preſent condition and allowance unto us. This Chriſtian contentment hath three properties, 1. It is inward within a man him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as the ciſtern; but it is from God as the efficient and fountain of all ſatisfaction and tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quility of ſpirit in his own children, <hi>Prov.</hi> 14.14. <hi>A good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> 2. It is voluntary, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 15.26. <hi>Behold here am I, let him do to me as ſeemeth good unto him.</hi> That ſpurious and adulterat contentment of ſome among the Heathens, did proceed rather from a forced ſubjection to a fatal neceſſity, or to
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:42750:83"/> fortune, (as they were wont to ſpeak) than from any voluntar ſubmiſſion to divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. 3. True contentment is equal and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, to wit, in every eſtate and condition of life, <hi>Phil.</hi> 4.11, 12. In proſperity it is without an immoderat deſire to have more; and in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity it is without murmuring or envying others their proſperity. Heathens had not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment in every eſtate; ſome of them could endure poverty, but no ways diſgrace; as was ſeen in <hi>Cato</hi> and <hi>Lucretia,</hi> who being overcome with grief and paſſionat impatience, did make themſelves away; which unnatural fact, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens did call an heroick act of a great and ſtrong ſpirit; but it was rather a fit of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and impotency; becauſe ſtrength of ſpirit appeareth moſt in bearing patiently the bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of adverſity, as <hi>Auguſtine</hi> reaſoneth well to that ſame purpoſe, <hi>Lib.</hi> 1. <hi>Cap.</hi> 20. <hi>of the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of God.</hi>

As the children of God do not deſire increaſe of

               <p n="2">2. The chief ground of true contentment is the favour of God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 4.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 30:5. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 63.3. <hi>Hab.</hi> 3.17, 18. And that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God is a ſoul-ſatisfying portion, is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent from theſe reaſons, 1. That which ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the ſoul of man, muſt be a good univerſal, to give contentment unto all the faculties of the ſoul: pleaſant ſounds delight the ear, but not the eye; and pleaſant colours delight the eye, but not the ear: but a ſoul receiving God and his favour, hath an univerſal ſatsifacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to wit, of light to the mind, of love to the will, and of delight and joy to the affections; they have as much of the enjoyment of God as they are capable of in this life; and would have more, if they were more capable. 2. The ſoul-ſatisfying good muſt be ſuch, as is intimat to the ſoul: worldly and ſenſual objects, ſtick for the moſt part in the ſenſe and imagination:
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:42750:85"/> but do not affect the reaſon with any ſolid con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment; they are as <hi>Saul's</hi> armour unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> looſe and ſhuffling: but the ſenſe of Gods loving kindneſs, is united to the underſtanding, and raviſhes the heart with joy, ſo that ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The ſoul-ſatisfying good muſt be that which is the ſupreme good; becauſe any inferiour good, cannot fully ſatisfie the deſire, ſo long as the ſoul knoweth of one ſuperiour and better: as <hi>Moſes</hi> was not ſatisfied with what he ſaw on this ſide of <hi>Jordan,</hi> until he was at the top of <hi>Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gah;</hi> ſo there is not a full and compleat ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction unto the ſoul, till we come to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> that is above: our greateſt ſatisfaction in this life, is to enjoy God by faith, by love, by peace in the Conſcience, and joy in the heart, which are the firſt fruits of eternal life. 4. The ſoul-ſatisfying good, muſt be permanent; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the very apprehenſion of a change, doth interrupt our preſent contentment, as may be ſeen in the intervals of chronical diſeaſes; the fear of returning fits, diſquiets the heart, even in time of health: all worldly objects are like a ſummer flood paſſing away, <hi>Prov.</hi> 27.24. <hi>Riches are not for ever, and doth the Crown endure to every generation?</hi> But the gracious preſence of God is like unto the Sun, ſhining more and more unto the perfect day of our full happineſs

Conſider how many better (poſſibly) every way than thy ſelf, are in a worſe world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condition; many of the dear children of God are ſhut up in priſon, when thou with thy poverty enjoyeſt outward liberty; many of them are under languiſhing diſeaſes, when thou art in health: <hi>

And <hi>Jonah</hi> was abſurd and moſt unreaſonable in his fretting and orping at the removing of the Gourd, which he himſelf never planted: ſo we ſee even the godly ſometimes have their own repinings of heart, when God, in his unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able providence, ſometime removes what him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf freely gave, whereas they ſhould be thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his rich and free bounty for the former loan; and ſubmiſſive to his wiſdom and ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raignty in removing what he himſelf gave.

Doth it not become thee rather to ſay, as thy elder Brother ſaid before thee, <hi>Joh.</hi> 18.11. <hi>The cup which my Father hath given me, ſhall I not drink it?</hi> 2. Thy fretting diſcontentment, is a queſtioning of the wiſdom of God, who knows well what is beſt for his own children; of the juſtice of God, who is righteous in all his wayes; of the ſoveraignty of God, who may diſpoſe of his creatures at his own pleaſure and wiſdom, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.14 <hi>God alſo hath ſet the one over againſt the other, to the end that man ſhould find nothing after him.</hi> The wiſe God, in his va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious providence, ſets proſperity at one time againſt adverſity, and contrariwiſe, as upon the earth there is oftentimes a valley and an hill joyned together: And conſider, thy diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentment is a queſtioning the love of God, who not only chaſteneth, but even ſometime ſcourg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth his own children, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.6. 3. Look un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Chriſt, and this will cure thy fretting canker of diſcontentment: Art thou in poverty? fret not, but look to him, who being rich, became poor for us; his ordinary fare was barley loaves and a few fiſhes, and he had not whereon to lay his head. Art thou reproached and diſgraced unjuſtly by men? do not thou fret and repine againſt providence, nor faint as one that could not live, but in the popular air: Look unto Chriſt, who endured ſuch contradiction of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.3.

               <p>THe fourth evidence of true and ſincere converſion to the Chriſtian faith, is peaceable-mindedneſs, and an harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſation: In the dayes of this great change, foretold by the Prophet, men who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their converſion by the Goſpel to faith in Jeſus Chriſt, were bitter and cruel to all with whom they converſed, and were to them like aſps and cockatrices, ſhall be new creatures, and ſo harmleſs, that other Chriſtians, like ſucking or weaned children, though weak and without power to defend themſelves, ſhall not be hurt by them; and theſe Chriſtians, that were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted before them, they ſhall live without any annoyance from them: for, after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, as it is ſaid in the Text, <hi>They ſhall not hurt nor deſtroy in all my holy mountain;</hi> that is, in the Chriſtian Church, ſo called, in allu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> where was the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> which was the place of the ſolemn Aſſemblies for the worſhip of God: for, the
<pb n="163" facs="tcp:42750:90"/> Pſalmiſt, ſpeaking of the <hi>Meſſias</hi> and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, reſembleth the Chriſtian Church by mount <hi>Sion, Pſal.</hi> 2.6. <hi>Yet have I ſet my King upon my holy hill of Sion.</hi> If any man from the prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of an Altar and Sacrifices to be in the dayes of the Goſpel (<hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.19. <hi>Mal.</hi> 1.11.) would infer, there ſhall be Altars and external Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices under the Goſpel, he may as well alledge, that the worſhip under the Goſpel, ſhall be upon a mountain, from this place, and from <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.2. All that can be concluded from theſe alluſions, unto the worſhip under the Law, is this; that the object of Worſhip will be one and the ſame, both under the Law and under the Goſpel, in reſpect of ſubſtance, but not in reſpect of ſome circumſtances and Ceremonies, which were to endure under the Law untill the time of Reformation by Jeſus Chriſt, Heb. 9.10.</p>
               <p>The Chriſtian Church is compared to mount <hi>Sion,</hi> 1. This mount was a Fort of the <hi>Jebu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites</hi> at firſt, but afterward taken by <hi>David,</hi> and inhabited by him: So by nature, our under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtandings, wills and affections, are ſtrong holds for errour, diſobedience and ſinful luſts, untill Chriſt the Son of <hi>David,</hi> ſubdue them by the power of his Word and Spirit, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4. <hi>The weapons of our warfare, are not carnal, but migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty through God, to the pulling down of ſtrong holds, caſting down imaginations, and every high thing, that exalteth it ſelf againſt the knowledge of God, and bringing into captivity every thought to the
<pb n="164" facs="tcp:42750:91"/> obedience of Chriſt.</hi> 2. Mount <hi>Sion</hi> was a place pleaſant and delectable for ſituation; ſo the Lord delighteth in his Church and people, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 149.4. <hi>The Lord taketh pleaſure in his people.</hi> Therefore they are called his <hi>Spouſe, Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. his <hi>Treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 135.4. and his <hi>Jewels, Mal.</hi> 3.17. 3. Although mount <hi>Sion</hi> was high and viſible, yet ſometimes it was over-clouded with a miſt: ſo the true Church, is not alike viſible at all times; as may be known from <hi>Elias</hi> his ſad complaint, 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 19.14. And in the time of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> the world groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed under <hi>Arianiſm;</hi> and many ſound believers were forced to hide themſelves in caves, and there to worſhip God. 4. Mount <hi>Sion</hi> was firm and unmoveable; ſo the Chriſtian Church, through the preſence and protection of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, will continue and endure, even to the end of the world, <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.18. <hi>Mat.</hi> 28.20.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> It may be asked at what time this propheſie of ſo great peace and outward pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſperity in the Chriſtian Church was fulfilled? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. That univerſal peace in the <hi>Roman</hi> Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, at the birth of our bleſſed Lord, in the dayes of <hi>Auguſtus Ceſar,</hi> cannot be the peace ſpoken of here; for that was before the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Goſpel unto the Gentiles; but the peace, ſpoken of here, is an effect of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel preached and believed amongſt them. 2. This Propheſie was fulfilled in part, even in
<pb n="165" facs="tcp:42750:91"/> the times of the holy Apoſtles; when perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, who ſometime, like wolves, had ſcattered the flock of Jeſus Chriſt, were converted to the Chriſtian faith, and became like lambs, of a meek and harmleſs diſpoſition; as was ſeen in <hi>Paul,</hi> and alſo in the ſometime malicious Prieſts, <hi>Acts</hi> 6.7. and many of the multitude, being ſometime like boars, enraged againſt Chriſt and his Diſciples, were by the power of the Goſpel tamed, and became of a peaceable ſpirit and converſation, giving up themſelves to be directed and guided by the Apoſtles in time coming, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.37, 38. 3. Many learned Divines, think this Propheſie began to be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 311. in the time of the Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour <hi>Conſtantine</hi> the Great; under whoſe happy reign, there was an open and peaceable profeſſion of the Chriſtian Religion, and free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in a great part from the Heathen perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: at which time (as many of them think) was the beginning of the thouſand years, ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of, <hi>Rev.</hi> 20.3. during which time Satan, or the Dragon, was bound and reſtrained in a great meaſure from the former manner of perſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and they think theſe thouſand years did expire, <hi>Anno Dom.</hi> 1310. at the riſing of the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Family among the <hi>Turks;</hi> at which time <hi>Aſia</hi> was overſpread with Mahometiſm; and ſoon after, in the year 1415. <hi>Conſtantinople</hi> was taken by the Turkiſh Emperour <hi>Mahomet;</hi> and the famous Temple of <hi>Sophia</hi> there, was
<pb n="166" facs="tcp:42750:92"/> turned to Mahometan worſhip. 4. This pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſie is fulfilled in part daily, when ſome un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, who in former time hated the Church and the communion of Saints, are, by the preaching of the Goſpel, converted unto the believing of the truth, unto the love of God and his holy Commandments, and unto the ſincere love of all Saints. 5. Laſtly, It is probable (as many learned men think, who yet are not for the opinion of the Millena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries) this propheſie ſhall be more viſibly ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled at the incoming of the fulneſs of the Gentiles, and at the national converſion of the Jews: Becauſe theſe great and frequent wars amongſt Chriſtians, of one Nation againſt another: and ſometimes civil wars in one Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among themſelves, are a great ſtumbling-block unto their converſion: but when this ſtumbling-block ſhall be removed out of the way by a more univerſal peace amongſt Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans themſelves, then ſhall the Jews, diſperſed now thorow the world amongſt Chriſtians, joyn themſelves to the Chriſtian Church, as it is propheſied, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 2.4. <hi>Mic.</hi> 4.3. <hi>Nation ſhall not lift up a ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> This univerſal peace, in all probability, will not be, untill the Goſpel be preached unto many nations that are yet in heatheniſm, according to the propheſie. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 19.23, 24. at which time the incalling of the fulneſs of the Gentiles, and peace amongſt
<pb n="167" facs="tcp:42750:92"/> themſelves, at leaſt more than in former times, will be a motive, bleſſed of God, for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bringing of the nation of the Jews unto the Chriſtian Church: for, it is ſaid, <hi>In that day ſhall there be an high way out of Egypt to Aſſyria, and the Aſſyrians ſhall come into Egypt, and the Egyptians into Aſſyria, and the Egyptians ſhall ſerve with the Aſſyrians; in that day ſhall Iſrael be the third with Egypt and with Aſſyria, even a bleſſing in the midſt of the land.</hi> Although the Chriſtian Religion, was planted in Aſſyria, in the times of the Apoſtles; for there was a Church then in <hi>Babylon,</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.13. and alſo a Church was planted in <hi>Egypt,</hi> in <hi>Alexandria</hi> by the Evangeliſt <hi>Mark;</hi> yet afterwards, and at this day. <hi>Aſſyria</hi> and <hi>Egypt,</hi> are overſpred with Mahometiſm: But this text of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> ſpeaketh of reſtoring the Chriſtian Religion to them before the incoming of the Jew<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and that after their converſion to the Chriſtian faith, Iſrael ſhall be for a third companion in a Chriſtian communion with them in the ſame Spiritual bleſſings. It is true, there will be ſtill untill the conſummation of the World, ſome wicked and malicious men, within the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible Church, as tares mixed with the wheat, untill the day of final ſeparation: but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the chief Rulers themſelves, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith, ſhall be ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by the power of divine grace, that they will not hurt nor deſtroy in all the holy moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="168" facs="tcp:42750:93"/> of the Lord; and Inferiors, who are mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, ſhall be ſo overawed by the wiſe and powerful providence of God; and alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained by Rulers fearing God; that they ſhall not be able to deſtroy in all the holy mountain. That the incalling of the fulneſs of the Gentils, will go before the incoming of the Jews, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from <hi>Iſa.</hi> 60.16. <hi>Thou ſhalt alſo ſuck the milk of the Gentiles, and ſhalt ſuck the breaſt of kings, and thou ſhalt know, that I the Lord am thy Saviour and thy Redeemer, the mighty one of</hi> Jacob. In theſe words, the Prophet fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telleth, that the Jewiſh Nation ſhall receive the doctrine of the Goſpel from the Church of the Gentiles, converted to the Chriſtian Faith be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them; and the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.25. <hi>Blindneſs in part is hapned to Iſrael, until the fulneſs of the Gentiles be come in.</hi> Therefore it is more than probable, that the incalling of the fulneſs of the Gentiles, ſhall preceed the incoming of the Jewiſh Nation unto the Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Faith: for although ſome particular perſons, in the times of the Apoſtles, and alſo after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, received the Chriſtian Faith; yet the incoming of the body of the Jewiſh Nation, was and is a myſtery, which God is his own good time, will explain, by bringing them into the communion of the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Oſerv.</hi> Men truly converted to the Chriſtian Faith, will forſake their former malice and bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter diſpotion to hurt and harm others; and will
<pb n="169" facs="tcp:42750:93"/> labour to be of a peaceable diſpoſition and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation: this is evident from <hi>verſ.</hi> 8, and 9. It is evident alſo from the happy change, which we may obſerve in true converts, recorded in the Word of God; as in the Epheſians, amongſt whom ſometime there were men, like wild beaſts, with whom <hi>Paul</hi> had an unpeaceable and fighting life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.32. but after their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion to the Chriſtian Faith, there was a great change in them, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 5.8. <hi>Ye were ſometimes darkneſs, but now are ye light in the Lord.</hi> Paul was ſometimes a fierce and unceſſant perſecuter of all perſons of the Chriſtian perſwaſion; but after his converſion, he became very tame and peaceable in his moderat and Chriſtian conde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenſion in matters indifferent, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.22. <hi>I am made all things to all men, that I might by all means ſave ſome.</hi> Theſe convert Jews, who a little before, in their bitterneſs of ſpirit, called the Apoſtles <hi>drunken fellows,</hi> do change their toon, and ſay in their compellation, <hi>men and brethren,</hi> Act. 2.37. The rude and ſevere Jaylor, who was officious in his ſeverity, doing more than he was required, afterward becomes more tame and peaceable, as may be heard in his civil compellation, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.30. <hi>Sirs, what muſt I do to be ſaved?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Queſt.</hi> If it be asked, what are the means by which we may, through Gods grace, attain a peaceable diſpoſition and converſation in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Chriſtian Church? <hi>Anſw.</hi> I humbly
<pb n="170" facs="tcp:42750:94"/> conceive, there be three ſpecial means; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by ſuch a diſpoſition and converſation may be attained, 1. Humility of ſpirit. 2. Sound moderation in judgment. 3. Mutual forbea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in love.

This Chriſtian moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on appears alſo, in ſhunning with all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectneſs, the two extreme errours diſtant from truths mediocrity: for although neutrality in matters of faith, neceſſary to be known and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, be very deteſtable; as was the neutra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity

<pb n="185" facs="tcp:42750:101"/> ſtrive one againſt another in a bitter emulation, but did ſtrive together, one with another in a godly emulation, for furthering the Goſpel. It is true, even in the Apoſtles times, there was diviſion in the Church of <hi>Corinth,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.12. but <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Cephas,</hi> were no ways the the Authors, or Abettors of theſe diviſions: they did not foment them by their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions, or by bitter emulation and popular ambition: <hi>Paul</hi> ſharply reproved it, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.13. and condemned it as a courſe not of ſpiritual, but rather of meer natural and carnal men, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.4, 5.

The cauſe thereof, was, that diviſion between the Roman and African Church; for <hi>Rome</hi> would have appeales to be made unto them from beyond the Sea: this was the cauſe the Hereticks, fleeing from the Eaſtern Church, got ſhelter in the Weſtern; that by ſo doing they might maintain their pretended priviledge to reviſe, and recognoſce all cauſes Eceleſiaſtical. What was the cauſe, thoſe who fled from the Weſtern Church, were countenanced and wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comed in the Eaſtern? Was it not their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the Weſtern Church, and their bitter emulation, that thereby they might maintain their emulation of ſupremacy? which ambiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, both in the Weſtern and Eaſtern Churches, proceeded from the pride of ſome chief Church Rulers, both in the one and other Church. In the Eaſtern Church, It is true, ſome godly and learned men have given, and ſometimes do give connivance to errour and hereſie, not out of any evil intention, but out of their exceſs of moderation, and charitable inclination, being deceived by the inſinuations of ſubtile Hereticks and Shiſmaticks; but ſuch connivance proved oft-times very unprofitable,
<pb n="187" facs="tcp:42750:102"/> yea, exceeding harmful unto the Chriſtian Church; becauſe thoſe diſſembling Hereticks, who ſeemed at firſt to be officious followers and flatterers of thoſe good men, afterward when theſe godly men that did tolerate them, were ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered to their Fathers, theſe deceivers began openly to vent, and violently to preſs upon o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, their opinions, as doctrins and matters of Faith, which formerly they had deſired to be in charity tolerated, as privat opinions: therefore we would beware of the beginnings of diviſion, Schiſm and all bitter emulation; for, if ye bite, and devour one another, take heed, that ye be not conſumed one of another, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.15.

Under the Law, the Doctrine of the Goſpel was deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered by <hi>Moſes,</hi> Deut. 18.15. <hi>The Lord thy God will raiſe up unto thee a Prophet from the midſt of thee, of thy brethren, like unto me; unto him ye ſhall hearken.</hi> And by the other Prophets, <hi>Acts</hi> 10.43. <hi>To him give all the Prophets wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that through his Name, whoſoever believeth in him, ſhall receive remiſſion of ſins.</hi> The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices under the Law, were ſhadows of the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.29.

Their lamps and lights within the Tabernacle and the Temple, were ſhadows of Chriſt the true light, who enlighteneth every one that cometh into the world, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. for, all natural light and knowledge is from him, and all who have ſpiritual light and knowledge they have it from him, who is the Sun of Righteouſneſs, and the brightneſs of the Fathers glory; they have it from him, and from no other. 3. This Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of the Goſpel, was moſt clearly preached in the fulneſs of time by our Lord himſelf, by his Apoſtles, and by all his faithful Miniſters un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the end of the world: therefore the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Goſpel, in the dayes of our Lord and his Apoſtles, is called <hi>a ſeeing face to face,</hi>

They differ in the degree of clearneſs and manifeſtation; for now under the full diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Goſpel, the Covenant of grace is more clearly manifeſted, than it was before the Apoſtles time, when it was vailed with types and legal ceremonies; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. 3.

This contempt, is reckoned by the Lord, a more hainous ſin, than any tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of the Law; and that it deſerveth a greater condemnation, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.19. <hi>And this is the Condemnation,</hi> &amp;c.

It is a rejecting of Chriſt himſelf, when his word is not received by men, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.48. <hi>He that rejecteth me, and receiveth not my words, hath one that judgeth him.</hi> 4. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renneſs and unfruitfulneſs in the dayes of the

That earth which hath the rain and plenty of the Goſpel often preached, and <hi>yet beareth thorns and brears, is rejected, and is nigh unto curſing, whoſe end is to be burned.</hi> For if the barren tree, which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down, and caſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the fire, what ſhall become of theſe trees that bring forth evil fruits? 5. The contempt of this glorious Goſpel, bringeth many times temporal judgements upon a Nation, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42.43.44. as it did upon <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> by the Romanes, and upon the ſeven Churches of the leſſer <hi>Aſia</hi> by the Turks and Mahometanes; and if at ſuch a time the outward ordinance of preaching the Goſpel, be continued in Gods rich mercy for ſaving ſome of his Elect; yet in his revenging juſtice, he withdrawes a bleſſing from the outward ordinance toward the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of ſuch a people, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.9.10. <hi>Go and tell this people: hear ye indeed, but underſtand not; and ſee ye indeed, but perceive not,</hi> &amp;c. and if men continue and perſevere in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt of the bleſſed Goſpel, they bring upon themſelves eternal judgement, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.27. <hi>Thoſe mine enemies, which would not, that I ſhould reign over them, bring hither, and ſlay them before me.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 1.6, 7, 8. <hi>It is a righteous thing with God, to recompence tribulation to them that trouble you,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>In flamming fire taking vengeance on them that know not God, and that

It is compared unto a pearl of price, <hi>Matth.</hi> 19.45, 46. and men eſteem much of precious pearls. 3. It is called the doctrine of glad tydings, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10. It brings to us the glad tydings of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, of pardon, and of true liberty through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt; ſuch tydings of peace ſhould be very acceptable to rebels; and the tydings of true liberty, ſhould be much eſteemed by us, who by nature are bond-ſlaves to ſin, and in bondage to the fear of death and damnation: therefore we ſhould acquaint our ſelves more and more with the knowledge of this Goſpel; and if we eſteem highly of it, we will delight much in it; as men delight much in theſe ſtudies that are in great eſtimation with them: 4. It is the golden charter of our heavenly inheritance;

The Manna was white and pleaſant to the eye, and alſo ſweet and pleaſant to the taſte, like waffers made of hony; ſo Chriſt in himſelf, the true <hi>Manna,</hi> is moſt pleaſant, without ſpot, and without blame, as alſo he is a moſt pleaſant fight to them that repent and believe the Promiſe: as the ſight of a Corner-ſtone, is very comfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to a weary perſon ſinking under an heavy burden, as the ſight of the brazen ſerpent in the wilderneſs, was moſt comfortable to thoſe who were ſtung with the fire ſerpents. In like manner, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the true <hi>Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na,</hi> is ſweet and precious to Believers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. He is ſweet in the Promiſes, ſweet in the firſt-fruits of eternal life, when by the holy Spirit he ſheds abroad his love, like precious oyntment in our hearts, when he gives peace to our Conſciences, and joy to our hearts in the hope of Salvation: but the heart cannot conceive how ſweet and comfortable this true <hi>Manna</hi> will be in Heaven, when we ſhall be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with the full and everlaſting Fruits of his glory: then ſhall we ſay as the Queen of <hi>She<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ba</hi> ſaid of <hi>Solomons</hi> glory, <hi>It was true that was told me on Earth by the Miniſters of the Goſpel; but the half was not told me of that I do now ſee and enjoy in Heaven.</hi> 3. They gathered the
<pb n="225" facs="tcp:42750:122"/> Manna in the morning; ſo by Faith, bring in Chriſt the true Manna, early to feed and refreſh thy ſoul: acquaint your ſelves in time with him, for he will not make new acquaintance at his ſecond coming with any, who neglected to come to him in this their day. He will ſay to the fooliſh and ſloathful Virgins, <hi>Depart from me, I know you not, Mat.</hi> 25.

God ordained a Pot full of Manna to be kept in remembrance of his ſpecial providence toward them in the wilderneſs, that from the remembrance of it, they ſhould praiſe him, and by Faith depend on him and his care, in time-coming: ſo lay thou up in thy memory any experience of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment at any time by the Word or Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and depend on him for time-coming in all thy wants ſpiritual or bodily: when thou findeſt any faintneſs or failing of Spirit, and no

There is a reſt in hope of the thing promiſed, though there be ſome commotion in the Spirit through weakneſs of Faith, untill the promiſe be performed to their ſenſe: this reſt is like unto ſome reſt the ſhip that was formerly toſſed with the waves, has now at Anchor, although not without ſome agitation and commotion. 3. There is a reſt and peace in the ſoul, from the full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Faith, when the heart is perſwaded by the holy Spirit, and a lively faith reſting on Jeſus Chriſt, that their ſins are forgiven them, and that they are reconciled in the blood of Jeſus Chriſt: ſuch an aſſurance had <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.38, 39. <hi>For I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God, which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> This reſt, is like the quietneſs a great debtor has in his ſpirit, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he hath received his diſcharge out of the hand of his creditor. 4. There is the reſt of viſion and fruition in Heaven, when we ſhall ee and enjoy God, and be ſatisfied to the ull, with that fulneſs of joy, and with thoſe
<pb n="229" facs="tcp:42750:124"/> pleaſures for evermore at his right hand, <hi>Pſa.</hi> 16.11.

Daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe is a mean to preſerve natural life and health in ſome vigour, becauſe, through want of exerciſe, the body becometh lazy, and the life leſs active: ſo daily exerciſing of our ſelves to keep a good conſcience void of offence to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God and men, is a notable mean to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the life of grace in ſome vigour; as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Acts</hi> 24.16. 4.

It was the wiſdom of the Shunamite, to come unto <hi>Eliſha,</hi> that he might reſtore life to her child, who had gotten life at firſt by the help of his prayers: ſo it is the wiſdom of believers, when in their ſenſe, they ſeem to be dead and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the life of grace, that ſometime they had; at ſuch a time to go to Chriſt, and by prayer and faith to wreſtle with him, that he may come by his Spirit, and revive their fainting ſoul: It is their wiſdom to do as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Mat.</hi> 14.30, 31. who beginning to ſink, immediatly he cried, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Lord ſave me,</hi> and immediatly Jeſus ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed forth his hand and ſaved him: ſo although the Lord may ſuffer thee to ſink and fail in ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, that thou may ſee and be humbled with the ſight of thine own weakneſs: yet if thou run to him by prayer, he will not ſuffer thee to drown; but will ſtretch forth his hand of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer, and revive thee and renew the vigour of thy faith, that thou may praiſe him who is the Author, the Preſerver, and the Perfecter of the life of grace in his Saints.

               </gap>. As for the manner of his death, <hi>If I be lifted up from the earth;</hi> There was a twofold lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up of Chriſt: one from the earth unto the Croſs, whereto his body was nailed at his death, whereof here, and <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14. There was ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther lifting up after his death, unto the Throne of glory in Heaven, <hi>Acts</hi> 5.31. <hi>Him hath God exalted with his right hand, to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael, and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givenneſs of ſins.</hi> By his lifting up upon the Croſs, and the merit of his death, he procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the remiſſion of our ſins; and by his lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up, after his death, to the Fathers right hand, he doth apply the remiſſion of ſins by his interceſſion. Our bleſſed Lord gave himſelf willingly for his ſheep, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.14. <hi>Joh.</hi> 10.17, 18. for if he had been pleaſed to make uſe of his own Almighty power, all the power of the world could not have taken his life from him; he that with one word did caſt his enemies to the ground; who by his power, even upon the Croſs, did rent the rocks, he could eaſily have rent in pieces the tree whereto his body was nailed: yet in his wiſdom, he was pleaſed to ſuffer death at the hands of his enemies: though his death was ſimply voluntar, yet in ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects
<pb n="238" facs="tcp:42750:129"/> it was neceſſar. 1. There was a neceſſity of it, in reſpect of the puniſhment threatned againſt man upon his diſobedience, <hi>The day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die:</hi> therefore there was a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ſatisfaction to divine truth and juſtice by the death of Chriſt, the Mediator and ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the Covenant of Grace, which was made in him, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.16. and ratified by him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.22. 2. There was a neceſſity in reſpect of Gods de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree to ſend his Son, that he might make ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to Divine Juſtice in our nature; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid by our Lord, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.6. <hi>Thine they were, and thou gaveſt them to me.</hi> They were the Fathers by election; and given to the Son, that he might ſatisfie for them, reconcile them, and in end bring them to the ſalvation appoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them: As a King reſolving to releaſe and give liberty to ſo many Rebels, Priſoners, giveth them over to his Son, that he may pay their ranſome, and ſo obtain their liberty, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Fathers decree. For this cauſe, our bleſſed Lord, in reſpect of the decree of the Father to ſend him into the world, that he might die and ſave his elect, is called the <hi>Lamb</hi> fore-ordained or predeſtinated, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.20.</p>
            <p>This manner of death of our bleſſed Lord upon the Croſs, was neceſſary, 1. That he might be anſwerable to that type of the <hi>brazen Serpent</hi> lifted up in the wilderneſs, <hi>Job.</hi> 3.14. <hi>And as</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the Serpent in the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up.</hi>
               <pb n="239" facs="tcp:42750:129"/> 2. That by this manner of death, he might de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver us from the curſe of the Law, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Chriſt hath redeemed us from the curſe of the Law, being made a curſe for us: for it is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, curſed is every one that hangeth on a tree.</hi> He underwent a temporary curſe, to deliver us from the eternal curſe and wrath due to the tranſgreſſours of the Moral Law: Although there be no proportion between the ſuffering of a temporary curſe, and the ſuffering of an eternal curſe, due to us; yet, the dignity of the perſon ſuffering, did give infinit value to the merit of his ſuffering, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.14. <hi>How much more ſhall the blood of Chriſt, who through the eternal Spirit, offered himſelf without ſpot to God, purge your conſcience from dead works, to ſerve the living God?</hi> And the perſon ſuffering, being the Son of God, made the vertue and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of his death, to be of infinit power to purge away our ſins, and reconcile God to us, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>But if we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowſhip one with another, and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> 3. Our bleſſed Lord died upon the Croſs, that by this ſhameful death he might merit our exaltation unto favour with God in this life; for, he made our peace with God through the blood of his Croſs, <hi>Col.</hi> 1.20. and that he might merit our exaltation unto everlaſting glory in the life to come, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. <hi>For the joy that was ſet before him, he endured the
<pb n="240" facs="tcp:42750:130"/> Croſs:</hi> this joy and glory ſet before him, as Mediator, was that glory and triumph he ſhould obtain over all his and his Churches enemies.</p>
            <p>It ſhould be our great deſire and endeavour, with the Apoſtle, to know Chriſt and him cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.2. To this knowledge all hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane learning ſhould be ſubſervient. It is of ſpecial uſe, 1. It will inflame thine heart with love to the Father, who<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> gave him to the death of the Croſs for thee, that thou ſhouldeſt not periſh, but, believing in him, thou might be reconciled with God, and get eternal life; It will inflame thy heart with love to the Prince of glory, when thou conſidereſt for whom he ſuffered this ignominious death of the Croſs: It was even for thee, who by nature was an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to God at firſt by a wicked inclination, and after thou cameſt to the years of diſcretion, thou waſt a rebel by thy wicked actings and works: Men ſometimes have died for their friends, as <hi>Codrus</hi> and <hi>Curius</hi> for the good of their countrey; but God commendeth his love toward us, in that while we were yet ſinners, Chriſt died for us, <hi>Rom.</hi> 5.8. when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt the painfulneſs of his death; hands and feet were pierced and nailed to the tree of the Croſs: In the hands and feet, which are the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities of the body, the ſinewes meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and convey the pain to all the parts of the body: And the purer and finer the complexion be, the ſenſe of feeling is the more quick, as a
<pb n="241" facs="tcp:42750:131"/> ſound and cleanly body is more ſenſible of the cold piercing Air, than a groſs humorous body. Look in narrowly to the inſide of his ſufferings, even the greatneſs of his ſoul-ſufferings; they cannot be conceived, how extreme they were: therefore the Greek Church, in their publick prayers, ſaid, <hi>For the ſake of Chriſts unknown ſufferings, have mercy upon us, O Lord.</hi> We may know ſomething of them from his expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, <hi>my ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful;</hi> Thou may ſee ſomething of them in his bloody ſweat; our raging fever in our ſinning, brought on him this bloody ſweat, that thereby he might cure us of the burning fever of ſin: we hear ſomething of his ſoul-ſufferings from his moſt ſad complaint to the Father, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me?</hi> we had forſaken God days with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out number, and he was deſerted of comfort for a time, to ſatisfie for our ſinful deſertions; and bring us into a communion of favour and glory with God. Conſider the ſhamefulneſs of his death; He was expoſed to the publick ſhame and reproach of his enemies, and of all the beholders; and ſhame to an ingenious ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is worſe than death; it racks and breaks their heart, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. <hi>Reproach hath broken my heart.</hi> Conſider his willingneſs to die, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 50.6. <hi>I gave my back to the ſmiters, and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair; I hid not my face from ſhame and ſpitting.</hi> Phil. 2.8. <hi>He humbled himſelf, and became obedient unto
<pb n="242" facs="tcp:42750:132"/> death, even the death of the Croſs.</hi> Conſider for what end our bleſſed Lord ſuffered all this pain and ſhame: his back was furrowed with ſtripes and ſcourges, that by his ſtripes we might be healed; his head was crowned with thorns, to get us a crown of immortal glory, he ſuffered all this pain and ſhame, to ſave thee from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme and endleſs pain and ſhame: How ſhould a ſick patient love his Phyſician, that preveens a dangerous fever? And how ſhould a male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factor love the man, who kept him from the ſhame of the pillory? How much more ſhould we love our bleſſed Lord, who by the death of the Croſs, hath ſaved us from that unquench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fire, and hath preſerved us from eternal ſhame and confuſion?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The frequent and ſerious meditation on the Croſs of Chriſt, will keep thine heart humble with godly ſorrow for thy bygone ſins, that crucified the Lord of glory. <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. <hi>And they ſhall look upon me whom they have pierced, and they ſhall mourn for him, as one that mourneth for his only ſon,</hi> &amp;c. It will mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifie the love of ſin in thee for time coming: ſorrow and ſhame are two mortifying paſſions; as a debtor is ſorry and aſhamed of the diſtreſs his ſurety was put to for his debt; and he is very ſparing to take on new debt, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The love of Chriſt conſtraineth us;</hi>

<pb n="243" facs="tcp:42750:132"/> thing may offend him, who died ſuch a death, to ſatisfie divine juſtice for our debts and ſins. It will mortifie thee to the World; to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful pleaſures thereof, and to ſuch things as take up the thoughts and affections of too ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>But God forbid that I ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſave in the Croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, by whom the world is crucified unto me, and I unto the world.</hi> Joy in the Croſs of Chriſt, ſuppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth, and in end quencheth, all ſinful joy; as ſweet odours bear down the ſtench of noiſom and corrupt vapours; ſo the ſweet ſmell of Chriſt crucified, doth bear down our vile luſts. This joy in the Croſs of Chriſt, ſurpaſſeth even all lawful worldly joy; as the wine of Chriſts own making in <hi>Cana, (Joh.</hi> 2.) did far ſurpaſs the wine at the feaſt, that grew by the induſtry of men.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The meditation of the Croſs of Chriſt, will encourage and ſtrengthen thee againſt all pain and ſhame of this preſent world in thy ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering for the name of Jeſus; when thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membreſt how thy Lord endured the Croſs, and deſpiſed the ſhame, to ſatisfie for thy ſins, and to purchaſe unto thee eternal reſt from all pain; to preſerve thee from everlaſting confuſion, to bring thee unto everlaſting glory, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the ſpirit of glory and of God reſteth upon you.</hi> Therefore whenſoever God calleth thee to ſuffering, go not to ſhift it, as a duty
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:42750:133"/> wherein others are more concerned than thy ſelf; When <hi>Octavius Auguſtus,</hi> was deſired by an old Souldier to ſpeak unto the Roman Senat in his favours; <hi>Octavius</hi> anſwered, he ſhould cauſe one ſpeak to them in his behalf; then did the Souldier open his breaſt, and ſhewed the skars of the wounds, he had received at the battel of <hi>Actium</hi> for his cauſe; and that he had not interpoſed any other between his body and the enemy: So Chriſt in his own body did ſuffer for thee, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. and when he calleth thee to ſuffer for his name, put not off that du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to others, ſeing he himſelf ſuffered for thee, as well as for others.</p>

The meditation on the Croſs of Chriſt, yeeldeth great comfort to us in all our fears, from our ſpiritual enemies, <hi>Col.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Having ſpoiled principalities and powers, he made a ſhew of them, openly triumphing over them in his croſs.</hi> In which words, the Apoſtle alludeth to the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom of triumph after great victories over ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; when the Captives were openly dragged in chains after the Chariot of the Conquerour: ſo our bleſſed Lord, by his death on the Croſs, as his triumphing chariot, hath led captivity captive. And, 1. ſpoiled Satan our Arch-ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, of all the Elect, who through the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of nature, are for a time, led captive at his will: Although now and then after their effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual calling and converſion, he infeſt and moleſt the children of God by his temptations and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls;
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:42750:133"/> yet the Captain of their Salvation, by the merit and power of his croſs, in end will give them the victory; as he prayed for <hi>Peter, Luke</hi> 22 30.

The Captain of our Salvation triumphed over the World in his own perſon, when for all the glory of the World he would not once ſtoop to the Tempter, <hi>Matth.</hi> 4.

He triumphed over death, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.56. <hi>O Death! I will be thy death.</hi> He hath taken the ſting from death: to the godly it is as the brazen Serpent in this wilderneſs, it has not a ſting; but will cure us fully of all the ſtings we got here; of the ſting of temptation; of the ſting of a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſcience; and of the ſting of venemous tongues. Thy death through Chriſt his victo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on the Croſſe, ſhall be unto the as the valley of <hi>Achor,</hi> an entrance to thy promiſed reſt. 4.

Drawing preſupponeth life in him that is drawn; for dead men are carried, and not drawn on their own feet, ſo actual faith and drawing near to Chriſt, preſupponeth the principle of grace and faith put firſt into the ſoul; therefore Chriſt is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the author and finiſher of our faith, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2. 3.

            <p>To the third I anſwer, there is an outward drawing and calling by the preaching of the Word, <hi>Matth.</hi> 23.37. <hi>Our Lord ſaith, O Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem! how often would I have gathered thy children together,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>and ye would not?</hi> There is an inward drawing by the cord of Faith and Love, wrought and faſtned in the heart by the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Act.</hi> 11.21. <hi>The hand of the Lord was with theſe Preachers, and a great number believed and turned unto the Lord.</hi> The out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drawing by the word, without this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drawing by the Spirit, is not effectual for mans converſion, <hi>Act.</hi> 13.45. The unbe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving and envious Jews were not drawn by the Word preached by <hi>Paul,</hi> but they contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted and blaſphemed his Doctrine, <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.2. <hi>But the word preached did not profit them, not being mixed with faith in them that heard it.</hi> Although the word preached be a mean
<pb n="250" facs="tcp:42750:136"/> ſufficient in its own kind, that is, a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent outward mean; yet is it not ſimply ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for converſion: As Plowing and Sowing, are ſufficient outward means for fruitfulneſs; but are not effectual without the firſt and lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter rain.</p>
            <p>This effectual drawing, is a drawing upward of the ſoul by faith unto an union and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with Jeſus Chriſt in his merits, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.65. <hi>No man,</hi> ſaid our Lord, <hi>can come unto me, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it were given unto him of my Father.</hi> The grace of faith is given to us from above; it is like a cord caſt down from the Rock of our Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, to ſave man from drowning and deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in his ſins; it is a drawing of the heart upward unto Chriſt by faith in this life, and a bringing of the ſoul to the enjoyment of glory in the life to come, <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.24. <hi>Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> The ſenſe of Chriſts love in dying for us, is like the heat deſcending from the Sun, and drawing up the purified vapours: It is like the Load-ſtone drawing up the hard and heavy Iron: The ſenſe of Chriſts love in dying for us, ſoftens our hard hearts, and turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them toward himſelf. 2. As it is a drawing of the heart up to himſelf by faith and love, ſo it is an obediential drawing by love and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the wayes of his holy Commandments: It is not a drawing only toward an outward
<pb n="251" facs="tcp:42750:136"/> profeſſion of the truth from the cuſtom of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, or hope of worldly applauſe or benefit; as <hi>Simon Magus</hi> was baptized, that he might retain the reſpect and following of many Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritans his old followers, who had now been bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized: neither is it a drawing to the profeſſion of the truth, only for fear of worldly loſs; as many of the Perſians became Jews in their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward diſſembled profeſſion, for fear of the Jews: But this inward drawing and believing, is from love to God in the will, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 110.3. <hi>Thy peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> that is, when thou, together with thy Word, exerts the power of thy invincible g<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is an equal and uniform drawing both of the inner and outer man; all the powers of the ſoul, like ſo many wheels, anointed and moved by the Spirit of God, are drawn after the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to the outward drawing of the Word, as it is ſaid of that extraordinary draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Spirit, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.20. <hi>Whitherſoever the Spirit was to go, they went.</hi> The underſtanding is enlightned by heavenly knowledge, and light within, by the Spirit of God, according to the outward light of the Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.6. <hi>For God who commanded the light to ſhine out of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, hath ſhined in our hearts, to give us the light of the knowledge of the glory of God, in the face of Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> The will is ſtrongly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined
<pb n="252" facs="tcp:42750:137"/> to embrace Chriſt, and is ſick of love to enjoy him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.8. The affections, like the inferiour wheels, are moved and carried toward Chriſt by an inlightned underſtanding, and by a vehement inclination of the will, <hi>Cant.</hi> 5.4 <hi>My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</hi> Although the drawing and motion toward Chriſt begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth from within, yet it ſtayeth not there, but draweth alſo the outward man unto Chriſt; the members of the body become weapons of righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom</hi> 6.13. As the motion of the Clock, is firſt within, and thereafter perceived in the regular motion of the Hand of the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rologe, and in the ſound of the Bell; ſo the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward drawing and motion of the ſoul, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in our outward regular actions, and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious communications. 4. It is a moſt ſweet and delightful drawing; the God of all grace by his preveening grace maketh us firſt willing, and then by his ſubſequent and aſſiſting grace draweth us moſt ſweetly, with delectation in our hearts after him: It is, as when one is drawn forward to a place from the ſent of precious odours, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.3, 4. It is as the ſpeedy mount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of an Eagle upon wing from the ſmell and fight of the dead carcaſe; ſo the ſight and ſent, through faith, of Chriſt crucified, doth moſt ſweetly and willingly draw an hungry ſoul unto Chriſt to be fed and refreſhed out of the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the merit of his death, <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.28. <hi>For

            <p>Therefore humble penitents ſhould look up by faith to Chriſt on the Croſs, as he is held forth to them in the Goſpel: The perſons ſtung in the wilderneſs, looked to the brazen ſerpent, and were healed; ſo whatever thy ſins hath been, and whatſoever be the ſting of thy guilty conſcience, confeſs thy ſins, with purpoſe and active endeavours for amending thy wayes; draw near by faith to Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be healed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.14, 15. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up, that whoſoever believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth in him, ſhould not periſh, but have eternal life.</hi> Although thy faith be weak, yet if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of thy ſins, and mourning for them, thou look to Chriſt alone for ſalvation, thou ſhalt be ſaved, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 45.22. <hi>Look unto me and be ye ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, all the ends of the earth: for I am God, and there is none elſe:</hi> which place ſpeaketh expreſly of Chriſt, if we compare <hi>verſ.</hi> 23. with <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.11.

The Sacrament of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm was miniſtred by <hi>Philip</hi> the Evangeliſt to <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> and yet there was no healing of that gall of iniquity in his heart: when a people look too much to the inſtruments, who preach the Word, or miniſter the Sacraments, it provokes our jealouſie, God many times to withhold aſſiſtance from the Miniſters, and a bleſſing from the outward means to the people: for all theſe outward Ordinances are but emp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ciſterns, till they be filled by an influence of power and life from himſelf, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63. <hi>It is the ſpirit that quickeneth, the fleſh profiteth nothing.</hi> The outward Ordinance, without the Lords ſpecial preſence and bleſſing, is like the ſtaff of <hi>Eliſha,</hi> in the hand of <hi>Gehazi,</hi> they do not quicken a dead ſoul, nor awake the ſleepy and ſecure ſoul, 2, <hi>Kings</hi> 4.31. Therefore inuſing

            <p>If thou go to him, thou needeſt not deſpare of healing, for in his own due time he will heal all that come to him, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Heal me, O Lord, and I ſhall be healed.</hi> There is no ſoul-diſeaſe incureable to him, though in it there were a complication of infirmities and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtempers, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.16, 18. <hi>Waſh ye, make you clean, put away the evil of your doings from before mine eyes, ceaſe to do evil: Though your ſins be as ſcarlet, they ſhall be as white as ſnow,</hi> &amp;c. Though thy ſins were inveterat through cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom from thy child-hood, like the Luna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tick child, <hi>Mark</hi> 9.21.

            <p>The neceſſity of <hi>a broken heart,</hi> is evident from the text, becauſe it is <hi>the broken heart</hi> only that God healeth. 1.

            <p>The means and helps for breaking of the heart, that in all men is naturally hard, are, 1. A laying to heart the ſevere threatnings of God againſt ſin, <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.29. <hi>Is not my word like an hammer?</hi> Many men hear the word of threatning, but are ſtill hardned, their heart is not broken; becauſe
<pb n="265" facs="tcp:42750:143"/> the threatning is not ſaid to heart by Faith. The old world, (<hi>Mat.</hi> 24.39.) though they knew the threatning of the deludge by the preaching of <hi>Noah,</hi> yet they knew not, that is, they laid it not to heart, till the flood came: The hammer breaks not the hard ſtone, until it be laid to it with ſome pith; but when it is laid to heart, it doth in ſome meaſure be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin the work of heart-breaking, <hi>Jonah</hi> 3.5. <hi>They believed God in his threatning, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed a faſt, which was a proclamation of their ſorrow for their ſins:</hi> Faith to the threatning, worketh fear in the heart, and fear breaks the heart with preſent ſorrow, from a preſent appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the wrath to come; this was the cauſe of <hi>Ahab</hi> his ſorrow and legal humiliation, 1 <hi>Kings.</hi> 21.27. but in the children of God, this fear and brokenneſs of heart, is ſo ordered in the wiſdom and mercy of God, that it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pareth them for the comforts of the Goſpel in Jeſus Chriſt; as <hi>Noah</hi> moved with fear and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion of the threatned deludge, prepared an ark to the ſaving of himſelf and his houſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.7. In like manner the children of God, warned and wakened by the threatning of the Law, flee in to Chriſt, the only Ark and propiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that covereth believers from the curſe of the Law and eternal wrath, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.1, 2. <hi>If any man ſin, we have an Advocat with the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Jeſus Chriſt the righteous: and he is the propitiation for our ſins.</hi> 2. Sad afflictions, laid
<pb n="266" facs="tcp:42750:144"/> home with conviction to the Conſcience, is a mean oft-times ordered by God to break an hard heart, as is ſeen in <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who was humbled by his fetters, and in the Prodigal, who was humbled by great famine and want: the unjuſt reproaches of enemies, contrary to their intention (like that man, who opened the Apoſtem in the body of his enemy, by a dart thrown at him) are ordered by God to break the heart of his children with ſorrow for by-paſt ſins: the reproaches of vile <hi>Shimei,</hi> calling <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> a bloody man in the matter of <hi>Saul,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in he was moſt innocent; yet it did break his heart with ſorrow in remembrance of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>riah.</hi> 3. A particular confeſſion of our ſins, is a mean bleſt of God to the breaking of the heart: when we conſider the circumſtances of their number and greatneſs againſt infinit Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, infinitly juſt, who will not clear the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, when we conſider the Omniſcience and Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni-preſence of God, that we have done this and the other evil in his ſight, and ſo have been ſhamleſs in our ſinning; as the vile adultereſs, is ſhameleſs by intertaining the adulterer in the preſence of her husband: when we conſider our wilfulneſs and obſtinacy in ſinning againſt the light of our own conſcience, as theſe men did, <hi>Act.</hi> 7.51. When we conſider our relapſes, like the Sow to the puddle, &amp; the Dog to the vomit, after many promiſes and reſolutions in the day of affliction to the contrair: when we conſider
<pb n="267" facs="tcp:42750:144"/> our baſe ungratitude, not only neglecting to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to the Lord according to his benefits be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon us; but alſo our rendring to him e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil for good, and ſo deſerving, that evil of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould never depart from us, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.15. 4. A particular regiſter &amp; remembrance of Gods former mercies in doing us good all our dayes, by providing for us, and preſerving us from many viſible and inviſible dangers; when we call to remembrance his patience and long-ſuffering in bearing with us in our ſins: this brake the hard heart of the Prodigal, when he remembred the former bounty of his gracious father. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.17, 18. 5. A ſerious and frequent meditation of death and judgement, will be a mean to break an hard heart, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

It broke the heart of <hi>Pauls</hi> companions, that he ſaid, <hi>they ſhould ſee his face no more,</hi> Act. 20.38. So the fear of the day of death and of judgement, ſhould break the hard heart, when they conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der if they go on and die in their ſins, they ſhall be ſeparate from God for ever, and never ſhall ſee his face. Therefore break thine heart with ſorrow for bygone ſins, break off thy courſe of iniquity by righteouſneſs; make

Look oft by Faith and frequent meditation upon Chriſt cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified: this is a ſpecial Medicine and Lenitive to ſoften the hard heart, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. This look to him by faith, is like the blood of the goat, which breaketh the hard Adamant; look on him wounded for thy tranſgreſſions, both in his body and ſpirit: ſhall the innocent Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner be wounded, and ſore diſtreſſed? and ſhall not the Principal debtor be wounded with ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for the debt he himſelf contracted? ſhall our ſpotleſs Cautioner ſuffer ſhame and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach? and ſhall not our hearts be broken with grief and ſhame for our ſins, which put the innocent Lamb of God to open reproach? <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22.6, 7. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.20. 7. Pray to God for a ſoft and broken heart, it is promiſed in the New Covenant, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.26, 27. Pray for the influence and inſuperable operation of the grace of God upon thy hard heart, that thou may know in thy ſelf what is the exceeding

<pb n="270" facs="tcp:42750:146"/> comforteth us in all our tribulation,</hi> &amp;c: For, as the ſufferings of Chriſt abound in us, ſo our conſolation alſo aboundeth by Chriſt: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by delivering them in their greateſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.9, 10. <hi>But we had the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of death in our ſelves, that we ſhould not truſt in our ſelves, but in God which raiſeth the dead: who delivered us from ſo great a death, and doth deliver: in whom we truſt that he will yet deliver us.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Lord healeth alſo, in a more ſpecial manner, thoſe whoſe hearts are broken with ſorrow for their ſins: This is the healing we ſhould deſire moſt, as <hi>David</hi> did in the time of his great ſickneſs, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 41.4. <hi>I ſaid, Lord be merciful unto me, heal my ſoul, for I have ſinned againſt thee.</hi> Our greateſt care ſhould be of ſoul-health, 1. Becauſe our care ſhould be greater to have the ſoul healed, than the body or outward eſtate: This was <hi>David</hi>'s firſt and greateſt deſire in the time of ſore ſickneſs, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 39.8, 13. he firſt prayes for deliverance from his ſins, and then, with ſubmiſſion, for delive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance from his bodily diſeaſe, <hi>Deliver me from all my tranſgreſſions: O ſpare me, that I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover ſtrength before I go hence, and be no more.</hi> The ſoul is more precious than the body; as men are more careful to have an Apoſtem in the inward and noble parts healed, than a ſcratch in the skin of the body; ſo our firſt and greateſt care ſhould be, to have the diſeaſes of our
<pb n="271" facs="tcp:42750:146"/> ſouls healed. 2. If the ſpirit be healed, and if a man have peace with God and his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, he will be able patiently to bear the infirmities of the body; But, <hi>a wounded ſpirit who can bear? Prov.</hi> 18.14. As a man having an Ulcer in his back, is much diſquieted, even with a little burden: but if the back be ſound and whole, he can walk quietly under a great burden: So when there is no health nor peace in the conſcience, a very ſmall affliction doth diſquiet and perplex our hearts: but when we have inward health and peace in the conſcience, we are able through the Lord, who ſtrengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth us, to walk patiently and quietly under a great affliction, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 23.4. <hi>Yea, though I walk through the valley of the ſhadow of death, I will fear no evil: for thou art with me, thy rod and thy ſtaff they comfort me.</hi> Pſal. 138.7. <hi>Though I walk in the midſt of trouble, thou wilt revive me.</hi> 3. Unleſe ye have a care of your ſouls-healing in this life, there is no coming to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſoul-health and ſalvation in Heaven: as the Lepers, under the Law, were not admitted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to publick meetings, till firſt they were cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and healed; ſo no unclean thing ſhall enter into the New Jeruſalem, <hi>Rev.</hi> 21.27.</p>
            <p>That we may the better underſtand what this ſoul-healing is, and how the cure is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, we would conſider, that <hi>ſin</hi> in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is compared oftentimes to ſickneſs, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 1.5. and in many places to leproſie. 1. In
<pb n="272" facs="tcp:42750:147"/> bodily ſickneſs, there is a privation and want of health, ſo in ſin, there is want of Original Righteouſneſs, which was the ſound conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of man in the ſtate of innocency. 2. In bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ſickneſs, there is a colliſion of humours, like contrary waves, making a commotion in the body; ſo in our corrupt hearts, there is a contrariety of unruly luſts, one deſiring this viſible and ſenſual good, and another luſt, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried after another ſinful object. 3. In ſickneſs there is conſumption, and a tendency unto death, unleſs it be preveened; ſo in ſin, there is a tendency unto eternal death, unleſs it be preveened by the pardon of our ſins in the blood of Chriſt. 4. In ſickneſs bodily, men oftentimes become weaker and weaker; ſo unleſs they be reſtored by ſanctification, ſinners grow worſe and worſe, 2 <hi>Tim</hi> 3.13 <hi>Evil men and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducers ſhall wax worſe and worſe, deceiving and being deceived.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Therefore, by <hi>healing,</hi> is meant ſpecially theſe two, 1. The forgiving of ſin to theſe who are broken in heart with ſorrow for it, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 33.24. <hi>And the inhabitant ſhall not ſay, I am ſick,</hi> to wit, unto the ſecond death: <hi>the people that dwell therein, ſhall be forgiven their iniquity.</hi> 2. The ſanctifying of a broken-hearted man, and healing him by degrees, from in-dwelling corruption, which many times over-maſtered him: theſe two acts of ſoul-healing, are ſet down, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 103.3. <hi>Bleſs the

            <p>The impediments of <hi>ſoul-healing,</hi> are, 1. Way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardneſs and frowardneſs of men, who cannot endure to have their wounds touched and ript up by the word of reproof, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.30, 31. <hi>They would none of my counſel; they deſpiſed all my reproof: therefore ſhall they eat of the fruit of their own way, and be filled with their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices.</hi> They cannot endure amputation and mortification of their ſinful luſts, which are as a gangren'd hand or foot, therefore they are not healed; but chooſe rather to pine away in their beloved luſts, than to have them cut off, and ſo to have their ſouls ſaved. 2. Hardneſs of heart, and ſtupid ſecurity, without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of the danger, and vileneſs of their ſins, makes them carleſſe to ſeek to the Lord for healing their ſouls, <hi>Mat.</hi> 13.15. <hi>For this peoples heart is waxed groſs, and their ears are dull of hearing, and their eyes they have cloſed, leſt at any time they ſhould ſee with their eyes, and hear with their ears, and ſhould underſtand with their hearts, and ſhould be converted, and I ſhould heal them.</hi> 3. Willfull rejecting of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and direction of the great Phyſician of our ſouls, given to us by his faithfull Miniſters,
<pb n="274" facs="tcp:42750:148"/> 
               <hi>Jer.</hi> 51.9. <hi>We would have healed Babylon, but ſhe is not healed. Mat.</hi> 23.37, 38. <hi>O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not? Behold your houſe is left unto you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolat,</hi> &amp;c. 4. A falſe conceit and imagination of our own righteouſneſs and ſoul-health, is a great impediment to the healing of the ſoul, as the Phrenetick man, who thinks himſelf whole, ſeeketh not the Phyſician for healing, <hi>Matth.</hi> 9.12. <hi>They that be whole need not a Phyſician, but they that are ſick;</hi> that is, they that are ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of their ſouls diſtemper through the mala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of ſin, are ſenſible alſo of a neceſſity to be healed.</p>
            <p>The outward means of Soul-healing, are the Word, ſpecially the Goſpel-promiſes, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 107 20 <hi>He ſent his Word and healed them. Iſai.</hi> 57.15 <hi>Thus ſaith the high and lofty One,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>I dwell in the high and holy place; with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humhle, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones. Iſai.</hi> 61.1 <hi>The Lord God hath ſent me to bind up the broken hearted. Pſal.</hi> 51.17. <hi>The ſacrifices of God are a broken ſpirit: a broken and a contrite heart O God, thou wilt not deſpiſe.</hi> The Sacrament of the Lords Supper, is an outward mean for healing a broken heart; becauſe it is a viſible ſign and ſeal of our Communion of Chriſts Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy
<pb n="275" facs="tcp:42750:148"/> broken for us, and of his blood ſhed for us; and his offering of his Body, and our receiving of it by Faith, is the ſpecial mean to heal the broken heart by the vertue of his Body broken for us: Prayer is a mean bleſſed of God for healing a broken heart: <hi>Moſes (Num.</hi> 12.13.) cryed unto the Lord in behalf of his leprouſe ſiſter <hi>Miriam,</hi> ſaying, <hi>heal her now, O God, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeech thee.</hi> And (2. <hi>Chron.</hi> 30.18, 19, 20.) <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi> prayed to the Lord for healing and forgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the People, who had prepared their hearts to eat the Paſſeover, but had not been punctually cleanſed according to the purificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Sanctuary conform to the Law ceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monial: And it is ſaid, <hi>the Lord hearkned to</hi> Hezekiah, <hi>and healed the people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The inward means of healing the Soul, are ſpecially two. 1. Repentance, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn ye backſliding Children, and I will heal your backſlidings.</hi> Jer. 4.14. <hi>O Jeruſalem, waſh thine heart from wickedneſs, that thou mayeſt be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Repentance cleanſeth the wound, and let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth out the malignant humor. 2. Faith is a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial mean for Soul-healing; it is as the hand that applieth the healing-plaiſter; it applies the blood of Chriſt, wherewith the Soul is cleanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, <hi>Act.</hi> 16.31. <hi>Believe on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> As the Haemo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roiſe Woman, when ſhe touched Chriſt, was healed by the healing vertue that came out of him; ſo when a humble broken-hearted ſinner
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:42750:149"/> doth lay hold on Chriſt, and the promiſe made in him, healing vertue comes from him, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by guilt and obligation to eternal puniſhment, is taken away in our Juſtification, and the fever of corruption is much abaited, by the work and power of Sanctification.</p>
            <p>The manner of Gods healing the broken-heart, is, 1. Freely without any merit in man procuring the ſame; for, Who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be <hi>recompenſed to him again?</hi> Rom. 11.35. <hi>To this purpoſe ſaith the prophet, Iſai.</hi> 43.25. <hi>I, even I, am He that blotteth out thy tranſgreſſions for mine own ſake,</hi> &amp;c. 2. He healeth powerfully; ſo that when he puts to the hand of his invincible grace for healing, no diſtemper of the will can reſiſt him; for he takes away willingneſs to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt, and ſo he begins his healing in cureing the malignancy of the will, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.14. <hi>Heal me, O Lord, and I ſhall be healed.</hi> Jer. 31.18. <hi>Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turned.</hi> This effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of Gods grace in healing Souls, is called the exceeding greatneſs of his power to us<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, who believe, according to the working of his mighty power. It is a power, exceeding and overcomming the power of our corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, at the time when God is pleaſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 word">

               <hi>Obj.</hi> One poſſibly may ſay, my heart is bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſorrow for my ſins, and yet their is no healing of my ſoul, nor peace and quietneſs in my Conſcience; I may ſay, as <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.14, 19. <hi>I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the time of healing, and behold trouble. Anſ.</hi> God is debtor to none for healing; he healeth the broken in heart, but not becauſe their heart is broken: The diſtemper is meer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from our ſelves, but our healing is from his free Grace; with ſome ſinners he deals more
<pb n="278" facs="tcp:42750:150"/> roughly than with others, according to his Wiſdom and good Pleaſure, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 28.27. <hi>Paul</hi> is caſt down to the ground, but the heart of <hi>Lydia</hi> is gently opened; ſome are ſooner cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and comforted, to preveen deſpair; others are keept long under cure and exerciſe of Conſcience, to preveen pride and preſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption</p>
            <p>Therefore wait upon the Lord thy Phyſician, with all patience and ſubmiſſion. 1. Becauſe he hath promiſed to heal the broken in heart, and in zeal to the glory of his Truth, he will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form his promiſe, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</hi> Our pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is the thing he willeth, and after the proof of our patience, we ſhall receive the good promiſed, he doth not heal us to our ſenſe, at the firſt; <hi>David</hi> had not health and peace in his Conſcience at the firſt, upon the breaking of his heart for theſe two heinous ſins, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 51.8, 12. The Lord in his wiſdom, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpendeth healing and comfort, after the heart is broken, to the end in time coming we may be more careful to keep a good Conſcience, which is the box wherein the precious Jewel of Peace and inward Joy, is preſerved from rubbs and defilments. 2.

<pb n="287" facs="tcp:42750:154"/> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.7. <hi>The blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all ſin.</hi> He is the truth of all the lights and lamps in the Levitical ſervice, <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. <hi>I am the light of the world: he that followeth me, ſhall not walk in darkneſs, but ſhall have the light of life.</hi> He is the truth of all the Levitical Altars, as he was of their ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.10. <hi>We have an altar, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of they have no right to eat, which ſerve the taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacle.</hi> He is the alone Altar that ſanctifieth all our ſpiritual offerings, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. His death was the true antitype of the lifting up of the brazen Serpent in the wilderneſs; as is clear from the words in the text: in which we have a vive reſemblance between Chriſt crucified, and the brazen Serpent; as is clearly inſinuat in the particle of ſimilitude <hi>as,</hi> and in the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of reddition and application, <hi>even ſo.</hi>

            <p>The reſemblance is, 1. In that which was lifted up, to wit, the brazen Serpent, and the Son of man. 2. In the place, to wit, in the wilderneſs. 3.

            <p n="2">2. There was ſome reſemblance between that brazen Serpent and Jeſus Chriſt, who by way of excellency, is called, <hi>The Son of man,</hi> 1. That Serpent was in outward form, like unto Serpents that have ſtings; but really it had no ſting: So our bleſſed Lord, though he was in form like unto ſinful men, yet was he without all ſin, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3. <hi>He was in the ſimilitude of ſinful fleſh,</hi> it is not ſaid, <hi>In the ſimilitude of fleſh,</hi> for he was truly and really partaker of fleſh and blood; but without ſin: for he behoved to be clean him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, who was to cleanſe us; and to be whole and perfect, who was to heal us. 2. That Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent was not made of Gold, but of Braſs: <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboams</hi> Calves were made of Gold: Our Lords outward Garb and faſhion before the world, was without all ſhow and pomp, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.2. <hi>When we ſhall ſee him, there is no beauty that we ſhould deſire him,</hi> Luk. 17.20. <hi>The kingdom of God cometh not with obſervation.</hi> The ordinances of men are oftentimes very ſpecious in their out-ſide, as were the Calves of <hi>Jeroboam;</hi> but the Ordinances of God are ſimple, without outward ſplendor: as the holy Word preached in ſimplicity, and the holy
<pb n="289" facs="tcp:42750:155"/> Sacraments adminiſtred in ſimple elements, yet with them is great vertue, and a bleſſing to believers. The Word, accompanied by the Spirit of God, is the power of God to ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1.16. and worketh eff<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ple Ordinances of God, much more than in all the ſpecious and gliſtering inventions of men. One old zealous Father, at the Council of <hi>Nice,</hi> prevailed more with that young Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Philoſoph, for his converſion to the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, even by ſpeaking to him in the ſimplicity of the Goſpel, than all the learned Fathers could do by diſpute and arguing. 3. The occaſion of making and lifting up the brazen Serpent, was their great pain and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in being deadly wounded by the fiery flee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Serpents, <hi>Numb</hi> 21. So the occaſion, both of the Incarnation of Chriſt, and of his death upon the Croſs, was our ſins, wherewith we were wounded by the old Serpent, and had been in pain for ever, if Chriſt had not been
<pb n="290" facs="tcp:42750:156"/> Incarnat and died alſo for us; <hi>he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions,</hi> Iſa. 53.5.</p>
            <p>The conſideration of this, that our ſins were the cauſe of the lifting up of Chriſt upon the Tree of the Croſs, ſhould work in us theſe three penal affections, 1. Grief and great ſorrow for our bypaſt ſins, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12.10. <hi>David</hi> when he ſaw the innocent people deſtroyed by the Peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he was grieved at the heart, and ſaid, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 24.17. <hi>Lo, I have ſinned, and I have done wickedly; but theſe ſheep, what have they done?</hi> So we may and ſhould ſay in the grief of our hearts, What hath the innocent Lamb of God done, who was without ſpot, and blameleſs?

It ſhould work in our conſciences, ſhame and ſelf-indignation; and we ſhould afflict our ſpirits for our ſins, as <hi>Ephraim</hi> did, <hi>Jer.</hi> 31.19. <hi>I was aſhamed, yea even confounded, becauſe I did bear the reproach of my youth.</hi> 3.

So our bleſſed Lord took away our ſins, by bearing the burden of the puniſhment due to us; and thereby making ſatisfaction to Divine Juſtice, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 53.6. <hi>We have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord hath laid on him the Iniquity of us all;</hi> and verſ. 12 <hi>He was

Thoughts of the croſs of Chriſt, have an active and attractive Vertue: they will quicken our Faith, and draw us near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to Chriſt; where the carcaſe is, there will the eagles be gathered, <hi>Matth.</hi> 24.28.

This doctrine, from the force of truth upon the Conſcience, and for quieting the heart in the remembrance of our own unrighteouſneſs, the learned and worthy reformed Divines, have maintained according to the holy Scriptures; and the learned Biſhop <hi>Andrews,</hi> (in his <hi>Serm.</hi> on <hi>Jer.</hi> 23.6.) ſaith pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly and ſoundly, That if men would ſet God before them in his juſtice, and their own ſouls in their guiltineſs, they would interpoſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing between the revenging juſtice of God, and their guilty ſouls, but the alone righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Jeſus Chriſt: yea, ſome of the Roman Church, have acknowledged, that juſtification and ſalvation, is to be ſought only in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; as was evident from that directo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for viſitation of the ſick, reprinted at <hi>Venice,</hi> one thouſand five hundred ſeventy ſix; the prieſt is directed to propone this queſtion to the ſick perſon, <hi>Believeſt thou that none can be

               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the effects and ſigns where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I may diſcern the truth of faith, when we have not the vigor of it? <hi>Anſ.</hi> We diſcern it by the effects. 1. The true Believer has an high
<pb n="314" facs="tcp:42750:168"/> eſtimation of Chriſt, and a low eſtimation of himſelf: He is precious to Believers, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.7. <hi>Paul</hi> had an high eſtimation of Chriſt, that he came into the world to ſave ſinners; and a low eſtimation of himſelf, as being the leaſt of Saints, and chief of ſinners: The true be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever eſteems highly of the Goſpel, whereby life and immortality is brought to light through Chriſt. He accounteth all things but loſs; yea, but dung and unſavory, in campari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the excellency of the knowledge of Chriſt Jeſus his Lord, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.8. 2. The true believer, as he rejoices moſt in the croſs of Chriſt; ſo he mourns for his ſins, whereby he crucified the Lord of glory; he looks upon him whom he pierced with his grievous ſins, and he mourneth as one mourneth for his only Son, <hi>Zach.</hi> 12.10. 3. True faith, is a Magiſterial grace, and labours to quiet our unruly affections and paſſions, as an awful Maſter, by his preſence, quiets the unruly Scholars; for, faith receiving Chriſt in the heart to dwell there, commandeth all the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections to be ſtill, and to do nothing that may diſturb and grieve the Spirit of Chriſt; the Spouſe, after ſhee has found her Beloved, ſaith to her heart and affections, <hi>I charge you, O yee daughters of Jeruſalem,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>that ye ſtir not up, nor awake my love till he pleaſe:</hi> That ye neither interrupt his delight in me, nor my delights in him, <hi>Cant.</hi> 3.5. 4. True faith
<pb n="315" facs="tcp:42750:168"/> purifieth the heart, and labours daily to keep it clean by the beſſom of repentance, <hi>Act.</hi> 15.9. <hi>God put no difference between us and them, purifying their hearts by faith.</hi> The Lord is ſaid to dwell in the heart by faith, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 3.17. And after the believer has received him, he endeavours daily to keep the houſe clean where he dwells: by faith, the heart is eſpouſed unto Chriſt as a chaſt virgin, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. And when the believer is tempted to any vile luſt, he ſaith with <hi>Joſeph, how can I do this and ſin againſt my Lord, to whom I am eſpouſed for ever in holineſs and righteouſneſs?</hi> 5: True faith on Jeſus Chriſt, worketh by love, <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.6. It commands us, and in an holy violence con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us to love the Father, who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>given us much; to love the Son, who ſhed his blood for the remiſſion of ſins; an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> to love the Holy Ghoſt, who is the ſealer and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmer of our juſtification and remiſſion: Faith on Chriſt, commands us, and by a command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed act, requires us to love one another, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.23. <hi>This is his commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt, and love one another.</hi> As lines drawn from the circumference, the nearer they come to the Centre, they are the nearer one unto another; ſo believers the nearer they come by faith to Jeſus Chriſt, the Centre of our ſouls reſt and happineſs, they are the more united one to another in love; yea, when by faith we look
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:42750:169"/> upon Chriſt, as our great example, faith doth command us to love even our enemies, with the love of benevolence and beneficence; when we perceive our bleſſed Lord, both prayed for his enemies, and alſo healed <hi>Malchus</hi> ear; and in a ſpecial manner to love all ſaints with a love of complacency and delight, as fellow-mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the myſtical body of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and to walk in love, as Chriſt alſo hath loved us, and hath given himſelf for us, an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering and a ſacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling ſavour.</p>
            <p>It is therefore the wiſdom, duty, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of believers, to examine themſelves, that they be not only ſound in the doctrine of faith, but alſo ſincere in the grace and work of faith, that they may have rejoycing in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the teſtimony of a good conſcience, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.4. True and ſincere juſtifying and ſaving faith, receiveth Chriſt entirely to dwell in their hearts: the ſincere believer receiveth him in all his Offices; as a Prieſt, to bleſs the ſoul where he dwells, with all ſpiritual bleſſings; as a Prophet, to teach him by the Word; and as a King, to rule him by his Law and holy Commandments. As he receiveth him by faith, ſo he intertains him by love; as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth Chriſt by faith, ſo he gives up himſelf by love unto him; as Chriſt dwells in him by faith, ſo he dwells in Chriſt by love and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light; he intertains him by obedience in the
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:42750:169"/> courſe of Sanctification; as an honeſt Subject, who ſometime was a rebel to his Prince, the more he reſts upon the word of the Prince for his remiſſion, he is the more ready and active to obey him in all time coming: for though faith reſt on Chriſt alone, and on no other for Juſtification and Salvation, yet it reſts not from the duties of obedience in the courſe of San<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctification; the true believer in the preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his heart, is ready to every good work and commanded duty, with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Acts</hi> 9.6. ſaying, <hi>Lord, what wilt thou have me to do?</hi> For the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith, obligeth believers the more ſtrictly to the duties of Sanctification: for, knowing they are juſtified in the blood of Chriſt, which is the price of our redemption, therefore ſhould they glorify God in their body and in their ſpirit, which are God's, not only by the right of crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and temporal preſervation; but alſo by the right of redemption and everlaſting ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. Seing they have the promiſes of free grace, ratified in the blood of Chriſt, they ſhould cleanſe themſelves from all filthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the fleſh and ſpirit, perfecting holineſs in the fear of God, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. See more, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.15. <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12, 14. So that the Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of Juſtification by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, doth not make void the Law, but eſtabliſheth the Law, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. Though it make the
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:42750:170"/> Law void as to Juſtification by it, <hi>Rom,</hi> 8.3. yet it doth not make it void, or cancell it from being a fixt rule for our direction.

Our Juſtification, whereby our ſins are forgiven, and we are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved from the ſentence of damnation, through the perfect obedience and ſatisfaction of our Mediator, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: as a man ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to death for ſome hainous crime, is cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led a dead man, even before the execution of the ſentence; and when he is abſolved, he is ſaid to be a living man; ſo by nature, through ſin and guiltineſs, we are children of wrath, and dead in ſins and treſpaſſes, obnoxious to eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal death and damnation; but being juſtified by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, we are ſaid to live in Chriſt, and have the hope to live with him for ever. This life is purchaſed to us by the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the death of Chriſt, and is applyed by the Holy Spirit, working faith in us, whereby we are united to Chriſt, and receive, in and through him, remiſſion of ſins, offered to us in the preaching of the Goſpel, and ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

The act alſo and operation of the life of grace, is our Sanctification, wrought in
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:42750:171"/> us by the Holy Spirit, mortifying in us the deeds of the body, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.13 <hi>If ye through the Spirit do mortifie the deeds of the body, ye ſhall live,</hi> to wit, the life of glory in Heaven; and it is a quickening of us to live here unto righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as a man pincing away in ſickneſs, is ſaid to be a dead man in reſpect of his faſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching unto death; and when he is in the way of recovery, he is ſaid to be a living man; becauſe there are pregnant hopes of his better health and life. This life of Sanctification, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed alſo by Chriſt, is applyed and wrought in us by the Holy Spirit, through the waſhing of regeneration, and renewing of the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Tit.</hi> 3.5. 3. There is the life of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort and ſpiritual chearfulneſs; it's ſaid of old <hi>Jacob,</hi> Gen. 44.30. <hi>His life is bound up in the lad's life:</hi> becauſe he was much comforted in his ſon <hi>Joſeph.</hi> When ſin and judgement is ſet before us, our heart is dead and comfortleſs, like the heart of <hi>Nabal,</hi> whoſe heart, at the report of <hi>David</hi>'s wrath againſt him, died with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in him through fear, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 25.37. But when the Spirit of the Lord in our fears and faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, doth revive us by the ſweet and piercing ſmell of the croſs of Chriſt, received by faith into the ſoul, then we live a comfortable life, and our ſoul rejoyceth in God our Saviour, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.11. <hi>For we which live, are alwayes de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered unto death for Jeſus ſake, that the life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal

               <hi>Becauſe I live, ye ſhall live alſo.</hi> It is called the life of the Spirit, or by the Spirit, in this place, becauſe by the Holy Spirit, we are uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and joyned unto the Lord our Head and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, 1 <hi>Cor</hi> 6.17. <hi>He that is joyned unto the Lord, is one ſpirit:</hi> and becauſe we are renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a new life by the Holy Spirit, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of Water and of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.</hi> It is called the life of faith, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20. becauſe, by faith we receive the life of Juſtification, Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, and of inward comfort from Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="323" facs="tcp:42750:172"/>2. This life of grace, is abſolutely neceſſar as a midſt and neceſſar antecedent unto eternal life. 1. As the natural life is a neceſſar foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of natural actings and operations; dead Trees grow not, dead Animals walk not, dead men diſcourſe not; ſo the life of the Spirit in us, is the foundation of all our ſpiritual and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural actings: without this life, men are dead in ſin, and cannot grow in grace; without it, men are dead, and cannot walk in the wayes of Gods commandments; without it, men are dead, and cannot underſtand nor perceive the things of God in a ſaving way for the ſalvation of their ſouls, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.14. 2. The neceſſity of the life of grace wrought in us by the Spirit, appeareth in this, becauſe without it, there is no coming to the life of glory, <hi>Joh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> 3.5. This life of grace, is the infancy of the life of glory; and as one cannot grow up to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtature of a man, unleſs he hath been firſt an infant, ſo a man cannot be a perfect man in glory, except firſt he be an infant in the ſtate of grace: as one cannot be put into actual poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of an inheritance, till he firſt be born in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world; ſo no man can be put into the poſſeſſion of the heavenly inheritance, until firſt he be born over-again by the holy Spirit, the author of the life of grace, and the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parer and preſerver of us for the life of glory. This life, in, or through, the Spirit, is abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute neceſſar, even for all men who would
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:42750:173"/> come to the life of glory: for it is ſaid inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Except a man be born of water and of the ſpirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God:</hi> Though he were never ſo nobly deſcended of earthly progenitors, yet if he live not in the Spirit, it may be ſaid of him, as of <hi>Judas, It had been good for him he had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been born.</hi> 3. It is neceſſar for our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, to aſſure us we are united to Chriſt, and that neither life nor death ſhall ſeparat us from him: as life in the branch, is an evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of its ingrafture and union with the Tree, So our partaking of the life of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is a comfortable evidence, that Chriſt is in us by the indwelling of his Spirit, and we are in him by faith and love, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.13. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by know we, that we dwell in him, and he in us, becauſe he hath given us of his Spirit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. This life in the Spirit, is an excellent life, if ſimply conſidered in it ſelf, 1. In reſpect of that true and pure pleaſure that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it; the deceitful pleaſures of a ſinful life, are like the ſting of an aſp, caſting a man into a deep ſleep, but when the conſcience is awaked, the heart, through fear, is as <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhur, Magor-miſſabib,</hi> fear round about; the conſcience of a ſinful liver, is like a chiding wife in the boſome, caſting up to the man all the former evil wayes he has walked in, in the dayes of his former life. But the godly and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual liver, has much inward pleaſure and ſoul-ſatisfaction,
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:42750:173"/> 
               <hi>Pro.</hi> 14.14. <hi>The back-ſlider in heart, ſhall be filled with his own wayes: and a good man ſhall be ſatisfied from himſelf.</hi> His good conſcience, from the ſenſe of the life of the Spirit within him, is like <hi>Abiſhag</hi> to <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> in his old age; it doth cheriſh the inner-man, and warm it with a ſenſe of Gods love, ſhed abroad in the heart by the holy Spirit; it ſweetens common mercies to the man who lives in the Spirit. The primitive believers, from the ſenſe and comfort of the life in the Spirit, did eat their meat with gladeneſs and ſinglneſs of heart, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.46. Oh, that profane and worldly-minded men, who ſpeak of a holy and ſpiritual life, as a condition ſad and comfort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, would become ſpiritual livers in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and take a proof of that eſtate of life: I ſay to theſe men, as <hi>Philip</hi> ſaid to <hi>Nathanael,</hi> Come and ſee; and after ſight and proof, ye will ſay as the Queen of <hi>Sheba</hi> did, it was true that was told me; but not the half of that contentment and joy I find by experience, to be in a godly and ſpiritual life, was told me. The life in the Spirit has great and certain gain accompanying it, together with much unſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abl contentment, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.6. <hi>Godlineſs with contentment</hi> (that is, which has contentment alwayes attending it) <hi>is great gain.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.8. <hi>Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the promiſe of the life that now is, and of that which is to come.</hi> It has the promiſe of
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:42750:174"/> temporal bleſſings, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 34.6, 7. <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.28. and of eternal bleſſings, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9. <hi>Eye hath not ſeen, nor ear heard, neither hath it enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the heart of man to conceive the things which God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> Theſe who live in the Spirit, do live in great honour and reputation with God; and the greater and wiſer the perſon is, who doth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow the honour, it is the greater: but ſo it is, that the great and wiſe God doth eſteem much of men of an holy and ſpiritual life; he calleth them his <hi>Treaſure, Pſal.</hi> 135.4. his <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance</hi> and <hi>portion,</hi> Pſal. 35.12. his <hi>jewels,</hi> Mal. 3.17. <hi>The friends of God,</hi> 2 Chron. 20.7. <hi>The ſons of God,</hi> 1 Joh. 3.1.</p>
            <p>This life in the Spirit, is excellent, if com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the natural life: the life of the ſenſe is common to us with the brute beaſts, whereof ſome do excel men in ſome outward ſenſes: the life of reaſon, is common to us with Pagans and Infidels; and many of them in their philoſophy hath excelled us: yea, our living under the outward means of Word and Sacraments, is common to us with many hypocrits and caſtawayes; but this life in the Spirit, is far more excellent than that of ſenſe and reaſon: as a man by reaſon, doth far excel the moſt ſagacious beaſt; ſo doth a man, living in the ſpirit, excel the greateſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſts, who were, or are, void of the life of grace by the Spirit: natural men partake of
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:42750:174"/> the divine gifts, but ſpiritual and godly men are made partakers of the divine nature, by way of aſſimilation, 2· <hi>Pet.</hi> 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 4. And as for men, living, or rather dieing, and ſtinking above the earth in their vile luſts; a godly and ſpiritual life doth excel that vile and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable life, as far as light doth darkneſs, and Heaven doth Hell.</p>
            <p>Seing we live the life of grace by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, we ſhould be very watchful, that we grieve not the Spirit. 1. It is the worſt ſort of unthankfulneſs, to render evil for good; and it is alſo unnatural for children to grieve their parents, that under God are the author of their natural life, How great a ſin then is it, to grieve the holy Spirit the author of thy ſpiritual life? 2. Thou art ſealed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, who ſealeth thy eternal redemption to thy faith<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the promiſes of the Goſpel, and more clearly by the adminiſtration of the holy Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as the outward common ſeal, and effectually by the graces of the holy Spirit of ſanctification, as the inward and privy ſeal of thine heavenly inheritance, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 1.13. <hi>In whom alſo, after that ye believed, ye were ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with that holy ſpirit of promiſe.</hi> And, how loath are men, and in reaſon ſhould be ſo, to grieve the Kings Secretary, that has paſt their gift <hi>gratis</hi> through the Seals? 3. The Spirit of God is the comforter; And ſhouldeſt thou grieve him, who many a time has comforted
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:42750:175"/> and ſupported thee in the day of thy trouble and grief? If thou grieve the Comforter, to whom wilt thou go in the day of new troubles on thy ſpirit, for comfort and ſtrength?</p>

               <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ſe</hi> 1. Therefore grieve not the holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit in whom ye live, 1.

<pb n="333" facs="tcp:42750:177"/> 
               <hi>Rom.</hi> 3.31. <hi>Do we then make void the law through faith? yea, we eſtabliſh it.</hi> The Goſpel addeth a new obligation from the glade tidings of our redemption through the blood of Chriſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.20. <hi>For ye are bought with a price, therefore glorifie God in your body, and in your ſpirit, which are Gods.</hi> To this we are called by the Goſpel of grace, <hi>Tit.</hi> 2.11, 12. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Chriſt bare our ſins in his own body on the tree, that we being dead to ſin, ſhould live unto righteouſneſs.</hi> To this walking in newneſs of life, we are engaged by ſolemn profeſſion in Baptiſm, wherein we are ſaid <hi>to put on Chriſt,</hi> Gal. 3.27. and theſe who put on Chriſt, ſhould walk in newneſs of life, <hi>Rom.</hi> 13.14. <hi>Put ye on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and make not proviſion for the fleſh, to fulfill the luſts thereof.</hi> And Chriſt giveth ſalvation only to them who labour to obey him, by walking in newneſs of life, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. <hi>And being made perfect, he became the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of eternal ſalvation, unto all them that obey him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be three evident ſymptoms of natural life, to wit, 1. Appetite toward the means of life, 2. Growth and increaſe of ſtature, And 3. Motion and walking. In like-manner, there are three ſigns of ſpiritual life, 1. Appetite and deſire after the word and means of Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.2. <hi>As new born babes, deſire the ſincere milk of the Word.</hi> Although the renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed children of God, do not know ſometimes
<pb n="334" facs="tcp:42750:178"/> by the reflex act of knowledge and faith, that they live by the Spirit; yet others experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced Chriſtians, do know they live by perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſpiritual appetite after the means of the life of grace. 2. Growth in Grace and Sanctification, is a ſign of the life ſpiritual, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed into them by the Spirit; for the Miniſtry of the Word, is given for the perfecting of the Saints, for the edifying of the body of Chriſt; till we all come in the unity of the faith, and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the me<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.11, 12, 13. 3. Moving and walking in newneſs of life, with all reſpect to all the holy Commandments, is a ſign undoubted, that we live in the Spirit; becauſe theſe two are joyned together, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 36.27. <hi>I will put my ſpirit within you, and cauſe you to walk in my ſtatutes.</hi> As <hi>Lazarus,</hi> raiſed from death to life, did come forth from the ſepulchre, wherein he was laid, and walked in the ſight of others; ſo a ſoul quickened by the Spirit, doth riſe from his ſins, wherein he was dead and buried, and walketh before God and men in newneſs of life.</p>
            <p>There is a walking after the fleſh, directly oppoſit to walking in the Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.1. <hi>There is now no condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit.</hi> We muſt beware of ſuch walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe the end of it, is eternal deſtruction;
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:42750:178"/> for, <hi>he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption: but he that ſoweth to the ſpirit,</hi> or walketh after the ſpirit, <hi>ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting, Gal.</hi> 6.8. Such walkers after the fleſh, are profane men, walking preſumptuouſly in the imaginations of their own evil hearts, and yet thinking to get Heaven in end, as if a man walking toward the weſt, ſhould think in end to come to the eaſt: Of this profane and preſumptuous walking, and the ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, we read, <hi>Deut.</hi> 29.19. This is not to walk in the power of the Spirit of God, but in the ſtrong deluſion of their own deceived ſpirit: ſuch walkers are theſe ſpoken of, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3.3. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt dayes, ſcoffers, walking after their own luſts.</hi> And all ſuch al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo, who walk in a courſe of life, fulfilling the ſinful deſires and luſts of their own hearts. It is true, the godly, though renewed by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God, have fleſh and corruption in them, but they walk not aftr the fleſh, as their ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary guide and counſellour.</p>
            <p>The holy Scripture holds forth the manner of our walking in the Spirit, in theſe following qualifications, 1. In walking humbly with God, <hi>Micah</hi> 6.8. <hi>What doth the Lord require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy God?</hi> By keeping upon thy ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit the impreſſions of his greatneſs and holineſs, this will make thee to walk humbly: this made <hi>Iſaiah</hi> humble, after he had ſeen a viſible repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation
<pb n="336" facs="tcp:42750:179"/> of the Majeſty and Holineſs of God, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 6.5. <hi>Then ſaid I, Wo</hi> is <hi>me, for I am un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done, becauſe I</hi> am <hi>a man of unclean lips,</hi> &amp;c. This impreſſion, will make the ſoul obedient to the will of the Lord, as <hi>Iſaiah</hi> alſo was, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 6.8. <hi>Alſo I heard the voice of the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaying, Whom ſhall I ſend, and who will go for us? then ſaid I, Here</hi> am <hi>I, ſend me.</hi> This imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is a ſpiritual and heavenly-minded walking, having the way and haunt of the heart far above the things of the world, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from hell beneath.</hi> Such walking keepeth the heart free from the bondage of many temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſnares, wherein the earthly-minded man is taken and detained: as the Eagles, who ſoar in a high way, are not ſo eaſily ſhot and fell'd by the Fowler, as the greedy Cormo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants that flutter upon the ſurface of the earth, or the vain Stanchel that hovers in the air and embraceth the wind: In like manner, heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-minded men, are not ſo eaſily taken with the baits of the world, as greedy and ambitious men, who mind earthly things. 3. It is a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.15. Whereof here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after in <hi>Serm.</hi> on that place. 4. It is a ſincere
<pb n="337" facs="tcp:42750:179"/> and upright walking, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84 11. <hi>No good thing will the Lord God withhold from them that walk uprightly.</hi> It is a walking with a reſpect unto all the Commandments of God, as <hi>David</hi> walked, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.6. with active endeavours to keep a good conſcience toward God and man, as <hi>Paul</hi> walked, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.16. To have a good conſcience, and to be alwayes willing in all things to live honeſtly, as the Apoſtle did, <hi>Heb.</hi> 13.18. It is a conſtant walking, at leaſt in reſpect of a fixed purpoſe and reſolution, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 84 7. <hi>They go from ſtrength to ſtrength.</hi> Phil. 3.12. <hi>Not as though I had already attained, either were already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect: but I follow after, if that I may apprehend that for which alſo I am apprehended of Chriſt Jeſus.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The impediments of walking, are, 1. Want of light: for if a man walk in the night, he ſtumbleth, becauſe there is no light in him, <hi>Joh.</hi> 11.10. Therefore ſaid our bleſſed Lord to the Phariſees, <hi>Ye erre, not knowing the Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptures,</hi> Mat. 22.29. Therefore, as we would walk in a right way toward the Kingdom of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, we would labour to underſtand the holy Scriptures, which ſhew us the way of truth and righteouſneſs, and we ſhould daily pray with the holy Prophet, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 43.3. <hi>O ſend out thy light and thy truth, let them lead me, let them bring me unto thy holy hill, and to thy Tabernacles.</hi> And we ſhould pray with holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſ. 143.10. <hi>Teach me to do thy will, for thou art my God: thy
<pb n="338" facs="tcp:42750:180"/> ſpirit is good, lead me into the land of upright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> 2. Fetters are a great impediment to walking; ſo our unruly and exceſſive paſſions, as the exceſſive fear of creatures, exceſſive de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſires of worldly good things, exceſſive joy and delight in worldly pleaſures, are a great impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diment to ſpiritual and heavenly walking; as ſervants gazing and fixing their eyes upon ſome Pictures in their way, are ſtayed in their walking and in going about their buſineſs: Againſt this impediment we would pray to God for liberty and enlargement of ſpirit from that bondage to our maſterful affections; and we would turn <hi>David</hi>'s reſolution, (<hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.32.) into a ſupplication, <hi>O Lord, enlarge thou my heart, and then ſhall I run the way of thy Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> It ſhould be our daily prayer to the Lord with holy <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 119.37. <hi>Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity, and quicken thou me in thy way.</hi> 3. A heavy burden is a great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment to walking<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo when men over-bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den their ſpirits with the care of worldly things, they walk not in the way of righteouſneſs; but many times ſtep aſide after the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs: the love of the world hindered the rich young man to walk after Chriſt, <hi>Luk.</hi> 18.23. Therefore that we may walk readily and chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully in the wayes of Gods Commandments, we ſhould caſt all our care upon him, for he careth for us, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 5.7. And we ſhould pray daily, as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.36. <hi>Encline my heart unto
<pb n="339" facs="tcp:42750:180"/> thy Teſtimonies, and not to covetouſneſs.</hi> 4. Faint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is a great impediment to walking. <hi>Jonathan</hi> fainted in his way, till he taſted of the honey. Great difficulties and diſcouragments in the way of Holineſs and uprightneſs, are like the Sons of <hi>Anak,</hi> that diſcouraged greatly the people of Iſrael from walking up the hill, that thereafter they might enter into the promiſed Land. Againſt this impediment of fainting in the good and perfect way, from the many troubles and diſcouragements thou meeteſt with therein, recollect thy ſelf, and be encouraged from the Lords faithful promiſe, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 40.29. <hi>He giveth power to the faint, and to them that have no might, he increaſeth ſtrength.</hi> In all the bitter mockings thou meeteſt with from profane men, who not only mock thee, but ſpeak evil of thee, becauſe thou wilt not run with them to the ſame exceſs of riot, yet be thou reſolute and ſtedfaſt in thy ſpiritual and Chriſtian walking, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.51. <hi>The proud have had me greatly in deriſion; yet have I not declined from thy Law.</hi> Yea, walk the more ſincerely and ſpiritually in converſing with God by prayer, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 69.12, 13. <hi>I was the ſong of the drunkards; but as for me, my prayer is unto thee, O Lord, in an acceptable time.</hi> When the child of God has leaſt acceptance or communion with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane men, then is he moſt acceptable to God, and hath moſt of his countenance, which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves his ſoul from fainting at their bitter
<pb n="340" facs="tcp:42750:181"/> ſcoffings: look often unto Jeſus the Author and Finiſher of our faith, who endured ſuch contradiction of ſinners, leſt we, looking too much to men who wrong us, ſhould faint in our minds, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.2, 3. Be encouraged in all thy faintings from the hope of that Crown of Righteouſneſs laid up for all theſe who walk with God, as <hi>Enoch</hi> did. Walk with God in heavenly meditations; and walk thou before God as <hi>Abraham</hi> did in faith and obedience: the hope o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> that Crown ſtrengthened the heart of <hi>Paul</hi> againſt fainting, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 17. <hi>For which cauſe we faint not, but though our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward man periſh, yet the inward man is renewed day by day. For our light affliction, which is but for a moment, worketh for us a far more exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and eternal weight of glory.</hi> Therefore ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there is an infallible connexion between ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual life by the Spirit, and ſpiritual walking in the ſtrength, and by the direction of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, according to the Word, as there is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction of the ſtream with the fountain, if we live in the Spirit, let it be manifeſted by our walking in the Spirit; and if the Spirit dwell in us, the Spirit will quicken our mortal bodies, and raiſe them up to follow the Lamb where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he goeth: To him, with the Father and Holy Spirit, be all praiſe honour and glory, for now and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

            <p>The Chriſtian walking, is diſcribed here, 1. Poſitively, <hi>See that ye walk circumſpectly.</hi> 2. Negatively, <hi>not as fools.</hi> 3.

            <p>To walk circumſpectly, ſignifieth (as the original word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> importeth) an accurat and exact walking, like a man walking upon the ridge of a mountain, without declining to the one hand or to the other, <hi>Deut.</hi> 5.32. <hi>Ye ſhall obſerve to do therefore as the Lord your God hath commanded you: you ſhall not turn aſide to the right hand nor to the left.</hi> 1. In our zeal, we would walk circumſpectly, not overſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves to do more, than we have a calling from God to do, as <hi>Peter</hi> did in ſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with the ſword, without a warrand from Chriſt; and we muſt circumſpectly ſhun the other extremity, in omitting the duty of confeſſing the truth, when we are called thereto by God; it was the ſin of theſe fair profeſſors (<hi>Joh.</hi> 12.42.) they did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs Chriſt, for fear to be put out of the Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagogue. 2. We would ſhun circumſpectly all negligence and careleſneſs to do good works,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:42750:182"/> 
               <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.10. <hi>As we have therefore opportunity, let us do good unto all men, eſpecially unto them who are of the houſhold of faith,</hi> Tit. 3.8. <hi>This is a faithful ſaying, and theſe things I will that thou affirm conſtantly, that they which have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved in God, might be careful to maintain good works:</hi> becauſe every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit, is hewn down and caſt into the fire, <hi>Mat.</hi> 3.10. and we would walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, ſhunning the other extreme, in confiding into our own good works for juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation and ſalvation, becauſe, if God enter into judgement with man, none living ſhall be juſtified in his fight by their own works, which are very far ſhort of that exact righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs required in the law, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 143.2. Yea, <hi>Abraham,</hi> Father of the faithful, was not juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by his good works: for if <hi>Abraham</hi> were juſtified by works, he hath whereof to glory, but not before God, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.2. 3. We ſhould walk circumſpectly in uſing the things of this preſent world; not refuſing the good things offered to us by the good providence of God, whether riches, liberty or preferment to a more free and plentiful condition of life, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.21. <hi>But if thou mayeſt be made free, uſe it rather.</hi> And we ſhould walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly in ſhunning the other extreme, by abuſing the good things of this preſent world, to pride, riot, or vain confidence, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.17. <hi>Charge them that are rich in this
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:42750:183"/> world, that they be not high minded, nor truſt in uncertain riches, but in the living God, who giveth us richly all things to enjoy.</hi> 4. We ſhould walk circumſpectly with holy men in this world, not following them abſolutly in all things; for even the beſt of meer men, has their own failings: they are compared to the cloud in the wilderneſs, that had a light ſide and a dark ſide: we muſt not put darkneſs for light, nor light for darkneſs: but ſhould follow holy men with this limitation, <hi>in ſo far as they are followers of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.1. We ſhould follow <hi>Peter</hi> in his free confeſſion before the Council, <hi>Acts</hi> 4. but not in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial, in the high Prieſts hall. 5. We ſhould walk circumſpectly with wicked men, that we be not enticed to ſin by their evil counſel or example, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. <hi>When ſinners entiſe thee; conſent thou not.</hi> We would walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in forbearing to ſpeak any thing in their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, that may ſtrengthen them in their ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful courſes; or may be a ſnare to our ſelves, in giving occaſion to them to procure our hurt from theſe, who will make a man an offender for an inconſiderat word, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39.1. <hi>I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.</hi> 6. We ſhould walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhunning all appearance of evil, 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 5.22. Neither doing evil, nor evil like: for, by the appearance of evil-doing, we grieve the ſtronger Chriſtians, and ſtumble the weaker,
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:42750:183"/> we do wrong and prejudice to our own good name, which being preſerved entire, is bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then precious Oyntment, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.1. but being ſpoiled by the ſcandalous appearance of evil doing, it becomes unſavory to others, as Oyntment, corrupted by a dead flee: <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> walked circumſpectly; not onely he heark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned not to that ſhameleſs woman, but alſo would not abide in the ſame ſecret room with her, <hi>Gen.</hi> 39.10. <hi>Paul</hi> was very circumſpect in ſhunning all appearance of mal-verſation and unfaithful dealing in the matter of publick collections, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.20. <hi>Avoiding this, that no man ſhould blame us in this abundance, which is adminiſtred by us.</hi> 7. There ſhould be a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect walking, in ſhunning all occaſions and provocations to ſin, eſpecially familiarity with profane and riotous men, <hi>Prov.</hi> 4.14, 15. <hi>Enter not into the path of the wicked, and go not in the way of evil men,</hi> Prov. 20.25. <hi>With a furious man thou ſhalt not go, leſt thou learn his wayes, and get a ſnare to thy ſoul.</hi> For, evil company corrupteth good manners: can a man touch pitch and not be defiled therewith? can a man take fire in his boſom, and not be burnt? <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.20. Several ſins have their own ſeveral occaſions and provocations: but evil company is a magazine of evil occaſions and provocations for all ſins. 8. We ſhould walk circumſpectly, in abſtaining from leſſer ſins; becauſe ſuch being neglected and not noticed,
<pb n="346" facs="tcp:42750:184"/> are oft-times inlets to greater ſins: what is ſaid of one ſin, is true of all, <hi>Prov.</hi> 17.14. <hi>The beginning of ſtrife, is as when one letteth out water: therefore leave off contention, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be medled with. Peter</hi> went raſhly into the place of temptation, without a call; and thereafter denied firſt, and in end curſed if he knew the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: it is not a ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious and unneceſſar, but commendable preciſeneſs, to abſtain from leſſer ſins. 9. This circumſpect walking, is in an abſtaining from every thing that would provoke our predomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant ſin: old ſores are ſoon and eaſily rankled; therefore we would carefully keep aloof from it, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.23. <hi>I was alſo upright before him, and I kept my ſelf from mine iniquity.</hi> And we would ſhun alſo all occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, that are apt to induce us into ſin, as the occaſions of ſuperſtition and idolatry in the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of Gods worſhip. The Lord God forbad the people of Iſrael to plant a grove nigh un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Altar of God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 16.21. leſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, in reſpect of the nearneſs, people ſhould ſtep aſide from the Altar, and true worſhip of God, into a place or mannor of falſe worſhip.</p>
            <p>The cauſes of uncircumſpectneſs in our wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, are, 1. Want of knowledge, and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, as men for want of light, to diſcover dangers in the way, cannot walk circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Joh.</hi> 12.35. <hi>He that walketh in darkneſs,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:42750:184"/> knoweth not whether he goeth.</hi> Through want of knowledge, the Jews walked in a way of cruelty againſt our bleſſed Lord; and the Epheſians through the ignorance that was in them, gave themſelves over unto laciviouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to work all uncleanneſs with greedineſs, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.19. 2. The impetuous and vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment deſires, even in the godly and orthodox, hath made them in their eagerneſs of oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to one errour, through an immoderate deſire of counterpoiſing, (which <hi>Baſil</hi> calls <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) to walk uncircumſpectly toward another extremity of errour: ſome ancient Fathers, in their great zeal to oppoſe Manicheiſm, in aſſerting a fatal neceſſity of all humane actions, did incline too much to Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lagianiſm, and the extolling of the liberty of mans free will, above the ſphere of its activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as gardeners do bend a crooked branch too much ſometimes to the other ſide. 3. Pride and ſelf-confidence, maketh even the godly ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times raſh and uncircumſpect in their walking: <hi>Peter</hi> from ſelf-confidence in his own ſtrength, was raſh and uncircumſpect in his going into the High Prieſts hall. 4. Forgetfulneſs of death and judgement, and the accompt we muſt make to God of our walking in the time of our ſojourning here, doth make men walk at ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom in their evil wayes, as Jeruſalem ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time did, <hi>Lament.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Her filthineſs is in her ſkirts; ſhe remembereth not her laſt end,</hi>
               <pb n="348" facs="tcp:42750:185"/> Amos 6.3. <hi>Ye that put far away the evil day, and cauſe the ſeat of violence to come near.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Means and Helps for a circumſpect walking, are, 1. Sound knowledge of the good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable will of God from the word of light and ſalvation; becauſe the word of God, is the rule and meaſure, according to which we walk circumſpectly in obedience to the holy commandments, like children walking in one ſtep after another, according to their grounds and elements in learning, <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.16. <hi>And as many as walk according to this rule, peace be on them.</hi> When we walk according to this rule, we walk circumſpectly; for we need not be aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when we have reſpect unto all his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ndments, <hi>Pſal</hi> 119.6. This rule keeps us from wandering raſhly into the paths of wicked and profane men, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Concerning the works of men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the pathes of the deſtroyer.</hi> 2. As ye would walk circumſpectly, look to God in all your wayes; he is now a witneſs, and one day will be thy judge, <hi>Gen.</hi> 17.1. <hi>Walk before me,</hi> ſaith the Lord, <hi>and be thou upright.</hi> He ſeeth in ſecret, therefore walk circumſpectly in ſecret; although no man did ſee thee, yet the Lord ponders and conſiders all thy wayes, <hi>Prov.</hi> 5.21. <hi>The wayes of man, are before the eyes of the Lord, and he ponder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth all his goings.</hi> The all-ſeeing wiſe God,
<pb n="349" facs="tcp:42750:185"/> pondereth all the ſteps of humane actions in their deſires, intentions and courſes: though thy profeſſion be never ſo fair before the world, yet he ponders the intention of thine heart; he ſaw the hypocriſie and crooked walking of <hi>Jehu,</hi> notwithſtanding his fair and large profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of zeal for the Lord: He ponders the time of thy ſinning and unrighteous walking, if it be after mercies received, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32 13, 15. <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.7. <hi>When</hi> I <hi>had fed them to the full, they then committed adultery.</hi> The Lord ponders if thy unrighteous walking be in a time of affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, when thou ſhould walk humbly and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly; he obſerved wicked <hi>Achaz</hi> in his treſpaſſing more and more in the day of his diſtreſs, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 28.22. he ponders the place where thou walks in thy ungodly way, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 26.10. <hi>In the land of uprightneſs, will he deall unjuſtly:</hi> that is, in a place of uprightneſs, where he might have ſeen the good example of ſome men, walking uprightly and circumſpectly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God and the world, yet he will walk in the way of injuſtice. 3. Walk circumſpectly in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of the holy Angels, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.10. The Apoſtle will have women in the Church-aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, to carry themſelves decently in reſpect of the Angels, who are frequently there to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and admire the wiſdom and mercy of God, revealed to his Saints in the holy Word: they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>nd our uncircumſpect converſation and walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:42750:186"/> is very diſpleaſing unto them; as the raſh ſpeeches and actions of an inconſiderat pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, doth much grieve his Governour and Tu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. 4. Walk circumſpectly in reſpect of the godly, becauſe by thy raſhneſs and failings, thou wilt make the hearts of the righteous ſad: <hi>Paul</hi> was much grieved with <hi>Peters</hi> diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation at <hi>Antioch:</hi> by thy raſhneſs and fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, through uncircumſpect walking, thou ſtumbles the weak, who by thy evil example are drawen from the way of righteouſneſs: Many were drawn away by the example of <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> diſſimulation, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2. and how fearful and dangerous a ſin it is, to give offence to the weak, we may clearly ſee, <hi>Matth.</hi> 18.6. <hi>Paul</hi> would rather never eat fleſh, than he ſhould ſtumble his weak brother by eating thereof, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 8.13. Walk circumſpectly in reſpect of wicked men, who watch for thy halting, who will magnifie themſelves, when thy foot ſlip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peth, and ſpeak evil not only of thee alone, but alſo of thine holy profeſſion, and of all the Saints, as if they were all hypocrites: <hi>David,</hi> by his uncircumſpect walking, opened the mouths of adverſaries, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12.14. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore pray thou daily, as <hi>David</hi> did, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 27.11<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

               <pb n="351" facs="tcp:42750:186"/> from his wayes, and ſo ſin againſt the God of your mercies: This conſideration <hi>Ezra</hi> holds forth to the people of God, that in time coming they may walk more circumſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, <hi>Ezra</hi> 9.13, 14. <hi>Seing thou our God, haſt given us ſuch deliverance as this; ſhould we again break thy commandments, and joyn in affinity with the people of theſe abominations?</hi> The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of former mercies, made <hi>Heze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah,</hi> after his recovery from a dangerous ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to walk ſoftly and circumſpectly all his years, in the bitterneſs of his ſoul, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 38.15. And our bleſſed Lord, holdeth forth this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration to the man that was healed of a longſome diſeaſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.14. <hi>Behold thou art made whole, ſin no more,</hi> &amp;c. 6. Fear of thine own weakneſs, and fears from the many temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations and ſnares in this preſent evil world, is a ſpecial mean to make thee walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly: fear to ſlip and fall, maketh men walk circumſpectly in ſlippery places, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.20. <hi>Be not high-minded, but fear:</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore walk circumſpectly and humbly with thy God in the remembrance of his former mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, in the remembrance of thy former ſins; in the conſcience and ſenſe of thy preſent weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and in the fear of many and manifold temptations in this evil world; as a man walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth circumſpectly, looking well to every ſtep in the midſt of ſnares. 7. As ye would walk cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpectly, be not raſh to venture upon temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations:
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:42750:187"/> 
               <hi>Cyprian</hi> ſaith truly, <hi>Nemo periculo proximus, eſt diu tutus,</hi> no man near to the temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation and danger is long ſafe: his advice is good, that men would be circumſpect, like mariners at Sea, who in time of a calm, do not caſt anchor beſide a rock, becauſe they know not how ſoon a ſtorm may ariſe, and daſh the Veſſel againſt the rock: ſo a Chriſtian would be circumſpect, though his affections be quiet and ſtill for the preſent time, yet if he venture upon the place of temptations and ſnares, he cannot tell how ſoon the wind of temptation may ariſe, and bring the ſhipwrack of peace and a good conſcience. 8. As ye would walk circumſpectly at all times and in all places, remember often the neceſſity of our compearance after death before the tribunal of Jeſus Chriſt; this conſideration made <hi>Paul</hi> cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſpect, both in his perſonal and miniſterial converſation, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.9, 10. <hi>Wherefore we labour, that whether preſent or abſent we may be accepted of him: for we muſt all appear be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the judgement ſeat of Chriſt, that every one may receive the things done in his body, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.</hi>

Walk not in the way of worldly-minded and covetous men, who ſet up their reſt upon the things of this world, and make no conſcience of their purchaſe, for the Scripture calleth ſuch men, fools, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.11. <hi>As the partridge ſitteth on eggs, and hatcheth them not: ſo he that getteth riches and not by right, ſhall leave them in the midſt of his dayes, and at his end, ſhall be a fool.</hi> Luk. 12.20. <hi>But God ſaid unto him, Thou fool,</hi> &amp;c. 5.

               <hi>Demas</hi> did: this wiſdom is fooliſhneſs in Gods account; for, what avails it a man to gain all the world, and loſe his own ſoul?</p>
            <p>This Chriſtian Heavenly wiſdom, ſtandeth, 1. In mens propoſing to themſelves a good and happy end of their actions: when they propone to themſelves, as the great and ſupreme end of all their actions, the glory of God, of whom, through whom, and for whom are all things, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.31. <hi>Whether ye eat or drink, do all to the glory of God:</hi> when in the next place, they propoſe to themſelves that ſubordinat end, to wit, the ſalvation of their own ſouls, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.14. <hi>I preſs toward the mark, for the prize of the high calling of God in Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> and when they propoſe to themſelves the good of others, by following their own example in well-doing, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven.</hi> 2. True Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian-wiſdom, ſtands in a ſerious deliberation and ſearch out of Gods Word, what are the fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt means for attaining theſe ends; as by well-doing, and ſuffering for well-doing, to glorifie God, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14. <hi>If ye be reproached for the Name of Chriſt, happy are ye; for the Spirit of Glory and of God reſteth upon you: on their part he is evil ſpoken of, but on your part he is glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</hi> When we ſearch and conſider from the Word of God, that true repentance, lively faith, and ſincere obedience, are the means,
<pb n="357" facs="tcp:42750:189"/> whereby we attain ſalvation, <hi>Acts</hi> 3.19. <hi>Acts</hi> 16.31. <hi>Rom.</hi> 2.6, 7. 3. It ſtands in a careful and timous applying of the means neceſſary for theſe great ends: So if ye be truly wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians, ye will be diligent and active in uſing the means, whereby God may be glorified, and your ſouls ſaved; <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.13. <hi>Who is a wiſe man and endued with knowledge amongſt you? let him ſhew, out of a good converſation, his works with meekneſs of wiſdom:</hi> for God will have men to repent and turn, that they may live in his ſight, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live, ſaith the Lord God, I have no pleaſure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live.</hi> Ye muſt believe on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, for there is no ſalvation in any other, neither is there any other name under Heaven given among men, whereby we muſt be ſaved, <hi>Act.</hi> 4.12. And ye muſt walk in obedience to his will, becauſe he became the Author of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Salvation unto all them that obey him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.9. 4.

The wiſe Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian walketh according to right reaſon in his worldly deſires, and not according to paſſion and ſenſual appetite, which would be at the outmoſt point of his carnal deſires; for paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, not guided and moderated by prudence and right reaſon, do run into extremity of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, as is ſpoken of Iſrael, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Behold, thou haſt ſpoken and done evil things, as thou couldeſt.</hi> In ſo doing, men become fooliſh to the deſtruction of their own ſouls; like the Nightingale, delighting ſo much ſometimes in her own ſinging, that ſhe burſts. 7. The truly wiſe Chriſtian walketh wiſely towards them that are without the Church, and adverſaries to the ſacred truth, <hi>Col.</hi> 4.5. <hi>Walk wiſely to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward them that are without.</hi> 1 Cor. 10.32. <hi>Giving none offence, neither to the Jews, nor to the Gentiles, nor to the Church of God:</hi> becauſe in ſo doing, thou hinders (ſo far as lyeth in thee) the great end, to wit, Gods glory in their converſion to the faith and truth profeſſed by thy ſelf: to this end, the Apoſtle giveth ſound advice to all who live in an outward ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil ſociety with others, of a different perſwaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the matter of Religion, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.1. <hi>Let as many ſervants, as are under the yoke,</hi> to wit, of unbelieving maſters, <hi>count their own maſters worthy of all honour; that the Name of God, and
<pb n="359" facs="tcp:42750:190"/> his doctrine be not blaſphemed.</hi> 1 Pet. 3.1, 2. <hi>Likewiſe ye wives, be in ſubjection to your own husbands, that if any obey not the word, they alſo may without the word be won by the conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of the wives: while they behold your chaſt converſation coupled with fear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Worldly and contentious wiſdom, is directly oppoſite to true Chriſtian wiſdom, as is evident from <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.15. <hi>This wiſdom that hath with it bitter envying and ſtrife, deſcendeth not from above, but is earthly, ſenſual and deviliſh.</hi> It is called <hi>earthly</hi> from the object of it, becauſe it is imployed chiefly about things earthly: of ſuch wiſdom ſpeaketh <hi>Jer.</hi> 4.22. <hi>They are wiſe to do evil, but to do good they have no knowledge:</hi> wiſe to oppreſs others, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> Exod. 1.10. <hi>Let us deal wiſely,</hi> &amp;c. wiſe by wicked counſels to deſtroy the innocent; ſuch was the wiſdom of <hi>Achithophel</hi> in his counſel againſt <hi>David.</hi> It is a ſenſual wiſdom, to fulfill their own ſinful luſts, in taking the opportunities to do evil; as the young man, taking the opportunity of the twilight to go about the work of darkneſs and uncleanneſs, <hi>Job</hi> 24.15. and the vile adulte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſſe, taking the opportunity of her husbands abſence for her ſhameful and ſenſual ends, <hi>Pro.</hi> 7.19. It is the earthly wiſdom of a covetous man, by his ſpeeches to deceive and defraud the ſimple, <hi>Pro.</hi> 20.14. <hi>It is nought, it is nought, ſaith the buyer,</hi> &amp;c. It is called a deviliſh wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, from the Author of it, the ſubtile old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent;
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:42750:191"/> and it is rather craftineſs and ſubtile de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceit, than true wiſdom.</p>
            <p>The true ſigns and vive characters of the true Chriſtian wiſdom, are, 1. Theſe given by the Apoſtle <hi>Jam.</hi> 3.17. <hi>It is pure without mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of deceit; peaceable, without envy and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice; gentle, without deſire of revenge; full of mercy and charity, without grudging to give unto them that are in diſtreſs; and full of good fruits, to wit, of piety, ſobriety and righteouſneſs.</hi> 2. Where true heavenly wiſdom is, there will be teachableneſs, and willingneſs to hear a word of reproof when we do amiſs, <hi>Pro.</hi> 1.5. <hi>A wiſe man will hear,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Pro.</hi> 9.8. <hi>Rebuke a wiſe man and he will love thee. David</hi> loved <hi>Nathan</hi> and <hi>Gud,</hi> the faithful Prophets, who reproved him in the Name of the Lord. 3. A truly wiſe Chriſtian will endeavour by his good example, inſtruction and admonition, to win others to God, <hi>Prov</hi> 11.30. <hi>He that winneth ſouls, is wiſe;</hi> as a wiſe and faithful ſervant, by his good example of diligence, maketh other ſervants diligent and faithful in his Maſters ſervice. 4. True Chriſtian wiſdom, hath honeſt and harmleſs ſimplicity joyned with it, <hi>Mat.</hi> 10 16. <hi>Be ye therefore wiſe as ſerpents, and harmleſs as doves.</hi> 5. The truly wiſe Chriſtian, like the wiſe Merchant, preferreth Chriſt to all things; and like the wiſe builder, <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.24. he builds his comfort and confidence on Jeſus Chriſt the rock of his ſalvation, as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.33,
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:42750:191"/> 34, 35. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.14. <hi>God forbid that I ſhould glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſave in the croſs of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> 6. The truly wiſe Chriſtian, is an heavenly-minded man, having his affections ſet upon things above, <hi>Prov.</hi> 15.24. <hi>The way of life is above to the wiſe, that he may depart from hell beneath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The means and helps for attaining this hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly wiſdom, are, 1. Thou muſt be humble and denyed to thine own wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.18. <hi>Let him become a fool, that he may be wiſe.</hi> Thou muſt captivat all thy thoughts and imaginations to the wiſdom and will of God, revealed in the holy Word, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.4, 5. 2. To this end, thou muſt be well acquainted with the holy Scripture, which only is able to make thee wiſe unto ſalvation, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15. 3. Thou wouldſt carefully obſerve the experiences thou has had of Gods mercies in time by-paſt; this will make thee wiſe and reſolute in times of new difficulties, to depend on God and his help, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 71.17, 18. <hi>O God, thou haſt taught me from my youth,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Now alſo when I am old and gray-headed, O God, forſake me not:</hi> for, experience is the ſchool-maſter of fools, to make them wiſe: thou wilt alſo obſerve the Lords chaſtiſements upon thy ſelf in the former time of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boarding, and thou wilt be more wiſe in time coming, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.71. <hi>It is good for me that I have been afflicted, that I might learn thy Statutes.</hi> Thou wilt obſerve the uncertainty and viciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitude
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:42750:192"/> of all things worldly, and there-from learn to be humble and wiſe, not truſting, or inſolently glorying in things uncertain: but thou ſhouldſt be wiſe, and learn to glory in the Lord alone, with whom there is not a ſhadow of change: thou ſhouldſt obſerve the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God on wicked men, and learn to be wiſe in forſaking their evil wayes, <hi>Act.</hi> 19.16, 17, 18, 19. When many that believed, ſaw the judgement of God upon the conjurers, they burnt their magical Books, and forſook their unlawful arts. So the unclean perſon, obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the judgement of God upon the harlot, brought to a morſel of bread, and upon the prodigal waſter, cloathed with rags, and upon the proud man, as <hi>Haman,</hi> brought to open diſgrace, this ſhould make others wiſe to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in being chaſt, ſober and humble. <hi>Cato</hi> ſaid truly in alledging, wiſe men profited more by fools, than fools did by wiſe men; becauſe wiſe men ſee the faults of fools, and avoid them; but fools will neither ſee their own faults, nor follow the example of wiſe men. 4. If thou would be truly wiſe, frequent the company of theſe who are wiſe, <hi>Pro.</hi> 13.20. <hi>He that walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth with wiſe men, ſhall be wiſe: but a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of fools, ſhall be deſtroyed.</hi> 5. As thou wouldſt be wiſe, pray to God for wiſdom, <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.5. <hi>If any of you lack wiſdom, let him ask of God, that giveth to all men liberally, and upbraideth not; and it ſhall be given him.</hi> Pro. 2.3, 5. <hi>If thou
<pb n="363" facs="tcp:42750:192"/> lifteſt up thy voice for underſtanding, then ſhalt thou underſtand the fear of the Lord.</hi>

               <hi>Redeeming the time:</hi> To <hi>redeem the time,</hi> doth ſometimes ſignifie to gain time by delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſhifting of hard and difficult queſtions, which might bring the anſwerer into great dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; So, <hi>Dan.</hi> 2.8. the King ſaid to the Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans, who could not tell him the interpreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his dream, but deſired that he would ſhew them firſt the dream, he ſaid, <hi>I know of certainty, that ye will gain the time.</hi> To gain the time, is rendered by the ſeventy Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, in the ſame word that is uſed here: But we take the expreſſion here to be borrowed from Travellers or Sojourners, who ſleeping too long in the ſhort winter day, do haſtily riſe and walk the faſter, redeeming the time that was loſt by ſleep, and amend their paſe all the reſt of the day: or it may be borrowed from Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, preferring the opportunity of a good Mercat, and of buying precious wares, even to the time of their ordinary refreſhment, by eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.23. <hi>Buy the truth, but ſell it not;</hi> that is, with the hazard of any loſs worldly, lay thou hold upon the occaſions and opportunities of learning the ſacred Truths of God, but upon no terms ſell thou, or alienat the truth: or, the expreſſion is borrowed from frugal men, who retrench their Retinue, Dyet and all Superfluities, that by ſo doing they may
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:42750:193"/> redeem Houſes or Lands, morgaged formerly through miſgovernment or prodigality.</p>
            <p>It is a chief point of Chriſtian wiſdom, to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the time well; for it is ſaid here, <hi>Be wiſe, redeeming the time,</hi> as were, the wiſe Merchant, the wiſe Builder, and the wiſe Virgins, ſpoken of in holy Scripture, becauſe time is precious, <hi>Pro.</hi> 25.11. <hi>A word fitly or timouſly ſpoken, is like apples of gold in pictures of ſilver. Eſther</hi> ſpoke in time, in behalf of the Jews, and <hi>Jacob</hi> ſought the bleſſing in time; and the wiſe Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gins provided oyl in time: time paſt cannot be brought back again, like the running of water, that doth not return; and it is wiſdom for tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellers to take the opportunity of the tide be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it be ſpent: as our time is ſpent here, ſo will it be with us in eternity: it will be evil with them for ever, who ſpent the time of their life in following their luſts and ſinful pleaſures, and did not redeem loſt time, by repenting in time, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.25. <hi>But</hi> Abraham <hi>ſaid, Son, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member that thou in thy life-time receivedſt thy good things, and likewiſe</hi> Lazarus <hi>evil things: but now he is comforted, and thou art tormented.</hi> Gal. 6.7, 8. <hi>For whatſoever a man ſoweth, that ſhall he alſo reap: for he that ſoweth to his fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap corruption; but he that ſoweth to the Spirit, ſhall of the Spirit reap life everlaſting.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>There be three differences of time, as it is commonly taken; to wit, the time paſt, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent,
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:42750:193"/> and to come: we ſhould walk wiſely in reference to all theſe differences of times.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When we look back to the time paſt, that hath been miſ-ſpent in the vanities and follies of ſin, we ſhould be humbled as holy <hi>Job</hi> was, <hi>Job</hi> 13.26. <hi>Thou writeſt bitter things againſt me, and makeſt me to poſſeſs the iniquities of my youth:</hi> as holy <hi>David</hi> was, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 25.7. <hi>Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber not the ſins of my youth, nor my tranſgreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Cato,</hi> though an Heathen, repented (as he ſaid) that he had miſ-ſpent one day in idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: but all of us may ſay as <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90.9. <hi>Our years are ſpent as a tale that is told:</hi> we are like ſome careleſs hearers, who ſcarce know the ſubject and purpoſe of a tale, before it be near an end; ſo we know not the main end and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of our life, which is to know God, and to glorifie him, when we have known him; and the life of many is near to an end, before they conſider the great intendment of God in giving them life. We may ſay (as <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 11.10.) <hi>Childhood and youth are vanity:</hi> miſ-ſpent idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in doing little or no good, and oft-times in doing evil; and we may ſay (as 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.3.) <hi>The time paſt may ſuffice us to have wrought the will of the Gentiles,</hi> &amp;c. When we remember this miſ-ſpent time, we ſhould mourn, and reſolve by the grace of God, by amendment, to redeem loſt time, and ſay and do as <hi>Job</hi> 34.32. <hi>That which I ſee not, teach thou me: if I have done iniquity, I will do no more.</hi> How
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:42750:194"/> many opportunities of well-doing have we ſloathed and neglected? As of thankſgiving to God for benefits received, like unthankful Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.8. <hi>She did not know that I gave her corn,</hi> &amp;c. Of prayer and calling upon the Name of God, as Iſrael in the time of oppreſſing one another, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 53.4. <hi>Have the workers of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread; they have not called upon God.</hi> How have we neglected the opportunities of hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling our ſelves by faſting and prayer in a time of imminent or incumbent judgements? Yea, we have walked in revelling and riot, contrary to the Lords ſad diſpenſations, <hi>Iſai.</hi> 22.12, 14. We have neglected the opportunities of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the good Word of God, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.24, 25. We have refuſed the gracious invitations of the Goſpel, like theſe men, who made light of the Kings invitation to the Marriage-feaſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> 22.5. We have abuſed the time of Gods pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, that ſhould have led us to repentance, as it is ſaid, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.21. Not only have we been negligent, to lay hold upon the opportunities of well-doing; but alſo we have been forward and haſty to take the occaſions of evil-doing: How many have been ſo malicious, that like the cruel old Prieſt <hi>Annas,</hi> they could not ſleep till they had done evil? How many have taken op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, from the weakneſs of others, of their cruel revenge, as <hi>Simeon</hi> and <hi>Levi</hi> did? How many have taken occaſion from the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:42750:194"/> of ſome, or from the deſolat condition of others, as of Widows and Orphans, to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs them, and by their ruines build up an eſtate to themſelves? Such men ſhould redeem the time by repentance and reſtitution in time, <hi>Prov.</hi> 23.10, 11. <hi>Remove not the old land-mark,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for their Redeemer is mighty.</hi> Job 20.19, 20. <hi>Becauſe he hath oppreſſed, and hath forſaken the poor; becauſe he hath violently taken away an houſe which he builded not: ſurely he ſhall not feel quietneſs in his belly, he ſhall not ſave of that which he deſired.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the preſent time, we ſhould improve it to well-doing without delay; God, in holy Scriptures, urgeth the opportunity of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, <hi>Joel</hi> 2.12. <hi>Therefore alſo now, ſaith the Lord, turn ye even to me with all your heart.</hi> Pſal. 95.7. <hi>To day if ye will hear his voice,</hi> &amp;c. 2 Cor. 6.2. <hi>Now is the accepted time,</hi> &amp;c. The husband-man takes opportunity of the ſeaſon, for plowing and ſowing; ſo ſhould we of plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up and renting our hearts by repentance, and of ſowing in righteouſneſs: the ſea-faring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, taketh the opportunity of a fair wind; ſo ſhould we take the opportunity, when the Spirit of God breatheth upon us by the Word, without delay to depart from our ſins, and to advance toward the Port of eternal Salvation: Becauſe, 1. The neglect of the opportunity given us for well-doing, doth provoke God to withhold the like opportunity in time coming,
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:42750:195"/> 
               <hi>Joh.</hi> 7.34. <hi>Ye ſhall ſeek me, and ſhall not find me. Eſau</hi> came not in time to get the bleſſing; and he never got another opportunity for it. Jeruſalem would not in time know thoſe things that belonged to her peace, and therefore in time coming they were hid from her eyes, <hi>Luk.</hi> 19.42. <hi>Felix</hi> made not good uſe of the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity he had for hearing <hi>Paul</hi> preach; and he never got another convenient ſeaſon, <hi>Act.</hi> 24.25. 2. Though thou may have afterward an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of the outward Ordinances, yet through thy former neglect of them, thou provokes God to reject thy offerings, and outward duties; the Lord would not accept of the people of Iſrael their offer to come up the hill afterward, becauſe they had neglected the former oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of Obedience, when he had commanded them to come up, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.40, 41, 42. 3. The time is uncertain, in reſpect of the opportunity of the means of grace; for thou cannot tell how ſhort a time the mercat and offer of free grace may endure: the Lord may ſend a famine of hearing the Word of the Lord, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.11, 12. The time of thy life is uncertain; how many have been well and in health the one Sabbath, but removed by death before the other? 4. Conſider ſeriouſly, though the Lord may be found of thee on thy ſick and death-bed, after the many ſlightings of opportunities in the dayes of thy health and proſperity; yet ſhall it be to thee with much pain and wreſtling; as
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:42750:195"/> the people of Iſrael, were put to the pains of fourty years abiding in the wilderneſs, which might have been ſaved by the timous pains of fourty days, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. As a man that neglects the opportunity of a fair and favourable wind for ſailing, may poſſibly wait on a long time, before he have the like opportunity: Yea, though a man may repent truly and ſincerely upon his death-bed; yet it is not without much fear and jealouſie, that he hath not ſo much forſaken ſin through any true ſpiritual averſneſs from it, as from a meer want of power to act ſin in the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as he was wont formerly to do.</p>
            <p>A wiſe Chriſtian, ſhould redeem and improve the time in order to time coming: he ſhould make timous proviſion for the time to come, as <hi>Joſeph</hi> in the time of plenty, laid up pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for the time coming of famine. There be four things eſpecially we would make provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of, 1.

            <p>From this Doctrine of Redeeming the time, three ſorts of perſons are juſtly to be reproved, 1. Slothful Idlers, who redeem not the time, but from day to day, delay to put heart and hand to the work of their own ſalvation, like the ſluggard, <hi>Prov.</hi> 6.10. <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber.</hi> Such men are like to ſpend-thrifts, who neglect the appointed time for redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their morgaged lands; and afterward when they would, they have not the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:42750:197"/> 
               <hi>Luk.</hi> 13.24. <hi>Strive to enter in at the strait gate: for many, I ſay unto you, will ſeek to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in, and ſhall not be able.</hi> 2. Such as trifle away their time as the Athenians did, <hi>Act.</hi> 17.21. As theſe tatling widows did, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17. and as theſe buſie bodies, 2 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> 3.11. Such alſo who ſpend more time in their exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive recreations and gamings, than in their ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and lawful employments: eſpecially ſuch, who ſpend much of their time in dycing and carding. Such, of old, were ſeverely fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the laws, both of Heathen and Chriſtian Emperours; and by the Canons of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of <hi>Eliberis,</hi> were ſuſpended from the holy Sacrament, as witneſſeth the learned <hi>Ductor dubitantium:</hi> ſuch prodigal triflers of precious time, are like to ſome fooliſh perſons, who ſpend upon conceits and fancies the moneys that ſhould have been imployed to redeem their morgages: ſo theſe men play away their time, which ſhould be employed to redeem their former time, that was ingaged to their former fooliſh courſes. 3. The debauched waſters of time in the works of darkneſs, as uncleanneſs, drunkenneſs, oppreſſion, covetouſneſs, pride, malice, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Such men redeem not the time, but prodigally caſt it away: they are like unto profuſe waſters, who do not redeem the wod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſett, but take on more debt, and in end bring themſelves to ſinful, ſhameful and deſperat poverty: So theſe prodigal waſters and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchers of their time, bring themſelves in
<pb n="374" facs="tcp:42750:198"/> end to an everlaſting want of all comfort, as the rich glutton did, <hi>Luk.</hi> 16.23, 24.</p>
            <p>Therefore, let all ſorts and conditions of men, take with the warning to improve their time to the glory of God, and to the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of their own ſalvation. 1. Such as are in their adoleſcency and growing age, they would improve their young years to the glorifying of their Creator, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Remember thy Creator in the days of thy youth.</hi> Offer the firſt fruits of your age unto God, that your after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age may be ſanctified and bleſſed of the Lord: if the firſt-fruits be holy, the whole lump of your time and age will be holy, <hi>Rom.</hi> 11.16. <hi>Plato</hi> to this purpoſe ſpeaketh indeed like a divine Philoſoph, in his firſt book of his <hi>Repub.</hi>

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>aith reſt on the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, whoſe blood cleanſeth from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs. 2. Such as are in their prime, and meridian of their time, who are now in their full ſtrength of body and mind, Improve your time well; honour God, with the ſtrength of thy body: give not thy ſtrength and the flower of thy time to uncleanneſs and drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, like theſe curſed men, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 5.22. <hi>Wo unto them that are mighty to drink wine:</hi> by ſo doing they weaken the ſpirit, and conſume the body: they turn the good gifts of God unto rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt himſelf, as if a ſouldier ſhould employ his levy-mony to buy armes, wherewith he might fight againſt his King who gave it. <hi>Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben,</hi> the beginning of <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſtrength, abuſed his own time and ſtrength; therefore his dignity and excellency was taken from him: but <hi>Joſeph</hi> improved well his youth and ſtrength of body; therefore God bleſſed him, and his bow abode in ſtrength, in deſpight of all that ſhot at him. Now is the time wherein your ſenſes and judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are ripe and quick; uſe your time and judgement well, that ye may have comfort in old age, when ſenſes and judgement will fail, as they did in old <hi>Barzillay:</hi> but if your quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs be ſet on edge upon vain inventions, ye will be forced in your old age to ſay, as <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.21. <hi>What pleaſure have we, or fruits, in thoſe things, whereof we are now aſhamed.</hi> 3. And ſuch who are in their decrept old age, ſtouping
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:42750:199"/> toward the earth and the grave, let them not imploy their ſhort time and their affections wholly upon the things of the earth, when by the courſe of nature, they are near to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from it: Let them not be buſie in the things of the world, and careleſs of the work of their own ſalvation; I ſay to them, as the Lord of the Vineyard ſaid to thoſe, <hi>Matth.</hi> 20. <hi>Why ſtand ye all day idle?</hi> ye are come to your ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth hour, your time is near run, the night of death is near hand, wherein no man can work: therefore, before that night ſurprize you, delay not to enter unto the work of ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, which is begun ſalvation, and work it out in fear and trembling, that at death ye may rejoyce, and ſay with <hi>Paul,</hi> (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8.) <hi>I have fought a good fight, I have finiſhed my courſe, I have kept the faith; henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteouſneſs,</hi> &amp;c. Let them with old <hi>Simeon,</hi> frequent the temple, and make conſcience of the holy ordinances both publick and privat, in them waiting for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who will come to old expectants, as he did to old <hi>Simeon;</hi> and will put himſelf into the armes of their faith, that they may ſay at death, <hi>Mine eyes have ſeen thy ſalvation; now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſon brought by the Apoſtle, to preſs the whole complex duty, is, walking circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly, <hi>not as fools, but as wiſe, redeeming the
<pb n="377" facs="tcp:42750:199"/> time,</hi> is ſet down in theſe words, <hi>becauſe the dayes are evil:</hi> no day or time is intrinſecally evil, but good, being created of God together with the creatures, as the meaſure of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>durance of things created by God, which were all good in the beginning: but as man, by the abuſe of his own free-will, made himſelf evil, <hi>Eccleſ.</hi> 7.29. So he himſelf maketh his time and dayes evil, which are the meaſure of his evil actions.</p>
            <p>The holy Scripture ſpeaks of good dayes and happy times, ſuch as was the day of the birth of our bleſſed Lord, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.10, 11. ſuch as is the time of the preaching of the Goſpel to the Gentiles, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.2. ſuch as will be to the godly, the day of our Lords ſecond coming, which is called the day of refreſhment, of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtoring all things, <hi>Act.</hi> 3.19.21. and the day of full redemption, <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. The Scripture ſpeaketh alſo of evil dayes, wherein ſin and ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity doth abound; ſuch were the dayes where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>Noah</hi> and <hi>Lot</hi> lived; ſuch were the dayes wherein <hi>Iſaiah</hi> lived, when he complains of the decay of truth, of common honeſty, and of the abounding of violence, <hi>Iſ.</hi> 59.15. <hi>Yea, truth faileth, and he that departeth from evil, maketh himſelf a prey.</hi> Such were the times wherein <hi>Jeremiah</hi> lived, who complained heavily of them, <hi>Jer.</hi> 9.2. <hi>O that I had in the wilderneſs a lodging-place of way-faring men, that I might leave my people, and go from them; for they be
<pb n="378" facs="tcp:42750:200"/> all adulterers, an aſſembly of treacherous men, full of falſhood and diſſimulation,</hi> &amp;c. Such were the times whereof <hi>Peter</hi> foretold, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 3. <hi>There ſhall come in the laſt dayes, ſcoffers walking after their own luſts:</hi> Men blaſphemous and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane, mocking at the promiſes of God, and at the ſaith of the godly for truſting to theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes. Evil dayes alſo are the dayes of ſad and grievous calamities, <hi>Gen.</hi> 47.9. <hi>Jacob ſaid unto Pharaoh, few and evil have the dayes of the years of my life been.</hi> Such were the dayes of Jeruſalem in their firſt deſtruction by the Babylonians, and in their ſecond deſtruction by the Romans.</p>
            <p>In ſuch evil dayes, we ſhould walk circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectly; for, the Apoſtle urgeth this duty from this reaſon, <hi>becauſe the dayes are evil.</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, 1. God obſerveth the godly in their walking at ſuch a time eſpecially, wherein ſin and iniquity doth abound; he obſerved the uprightneſs of <hi>Noah,</hi> in the midſt of a crooked generation; and the righteouſneſs of <hi>Lot,</hi> whoſe ſoul was vexed with the unclean converſation of that evil time; he obſerved theſe few in the Church of <hi>Sardis,</hi> who had not defiled their garments with the pollutions of that evil time wherein they lived, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.4. 2 Evil dayes are critick dayes, wherein we may diſcern and judge of the good or bad diſpoſitions of men living in ſuch times; evil times are ſearching and trying times of the ſaith of the godly, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:42750:200"/> the proſperity of the wicked; thus the Prophets ſaith was tryed, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 73.28. <hi>But it is good for me to draw near to God.</hi> Such times are trying times of the patience of the godly, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.36. <hi>Ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promiſe.</hi> In ſuch evil times, the ſtedfaſtneſs of the godly is tryed, when many that were fair profeſſors in a time of proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, do make defection from the way of truth and righteouſneſs, as <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.68. when many that were ſometimes diſciples by profeſſion, went back and walked no more with Chriſt, then the ſtedfaſtneſs of <hi>Peter</hi> and of ſuch as were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed, was tryed and manifeſted: <hi>Peter ſaid, to whom ſhall we go? thou haſt the words of eternal life.</hi> 3. Evil times, wherein ſin and iniquity abounds, are perilous times, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1. <hi>This know alſo, that in the laſt dayes, perilous times ſhall come.</hi> They are called <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, times full of difficulty for the godly, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve themſelves from the contagion, or from the violence of ſuch times, if they will not run to the ſame exceſs of riot with the wicked.</p>
            <p>Preſervatives againſt evil times are, 1. Sound information from the Word of God, that by the light thereof, we may diſcover and ſhun the wayes of an evil time, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 17.4. <hi>Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the works of men, by the word of thy lips, I have kept me from the paths of the deſtroyer.

<pb n="380" facs="tcp:42750:201"/> therefore I hate every falſe way.</hi> 2. Give not conſent to the beginnings of any evil courſe, <hi>Prov.</hi> 1.10. <hi>My ſon, if ſinners entice thee, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent thou not.</hi> Becauſe conſent at firſt, may juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provoke God in his juſtice to leave thee to thy own counſel, and then thou mayeſt prove an active promoter, and violent driver on of the courſe of iniquity: <hi>Paul</hi> at firſt gave con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to the ſtoning of <hi>Stephen,</hi> and afterward made cruel havock of the Chriſtian Church. The courſe of iniquity is called a backſliding, <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.16. <hi>Iſrael ſlideth back as a back-ſliding hiefer.</hi> And if once thou begin to ſlide, thou cannot tell how far thine own corruption, and the evil counſel and example of wicked men may carry thee, as it did ſometimes the people of <hi>Jeruſalem, Jer.</hi> 8.5. <hi>Why then is this peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Jeruſalem ſlidden back, by a perpetual back-ſliding? they hold faſt deceit, they refuſe to return.</hi> At firſt men are deceived by their own hearts, and thereafter to excuſe and ſtrengthen themſelves in their own ſinful wayes, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and corrupt others by evil counſel and example: for no man at firſt comes to the hight of iniquity, according to the ſaying, <hi>nemo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pente fit peſſimus:</hi> but they grow worſe and worſe, deceiving, and being deceived, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.13 3. In a time wherein piety and righteouſneſs is mocked by profane and licentious men, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all manner of evil againſt the godly and upright, who will not run with them to the
<pb n="381" facs="tcp:42750:201"/> ſame exceſſe of riot, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.4. labour thou the more to preſerve thy ſelf from puſilani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, and baſe fear of their revilings againſt any complying with their ſinful wayes, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 119.51. <hi>The proud have had me greatly in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſion, yet have I not declined from thy Law.</hi> 4. In evil times, when a man is made an offend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er for a raſh and inconſiderat word, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 29.21. then preſerve thy ſelf by ſilence, except thou have a call from God to ſpeak, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 39 1. <hi>I ſaid I will take heed to my wayes, that I ſin not with my tongue: I will keep my mouth with a bridle, while the wicked is before me.

            <p>THe Particle <hi>For,</hi> points at the connexi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of theſe words with the laſt verſe of the preceeding Chapter; wherein the Apoſtle gave the reaſon of his not fainting under all the preſſures and afflictions he ſuffered in the body; becauſe he looked not ſo much by preſent ſenſe to the things he ſuffered here, as by faith and hope he looked to things eternal
<pb n="385" facs="tcp:42750:203"/> in heaven, to wit, unto an eternal reſt, and an immortal Crown of Glory, which not ſeen by ſenſe, yet he believed was reſerved for him in heaven: <hi>Now faith is the ſubſtance of things hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, the evidence of things not ſeen,</hi> Heb. 11.1. And the light afflictions in this preſent life, are not to be compared with theſe eternal things not ſeen nor perceived by ſenſe, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.18. What theſe eternal things are, the Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes in part, in the two firſt verſes of this Chapter; even an immortal and glorified bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the day of the reſurrection: therefore he faints not, but hath Chriſtian courage in all the pain and ſhame he ſuffereth at the hand of men, now in his frail and mortal body; for we know (ſaith he) although our earthly houſe of the tabernacle of the body ſhall be diſſolved; when all the pins and joynts will be diſſolved, yet we have a building of God, and we look for an houſe, even a glorified body, not of mans making and giving; though our frail body be framed in the womb by the Lord, yet the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified body is of the Lords making and giving, in a more ſpecial manner; becauſe in the day of our reſurrection, he ſhall change our vile bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, that it may be faſhioned like unto his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.21. It is an houſe eternal, and well ſituat in the heavens, where it will not be ſubject to ſtorms and tempeſts, as it is in this life: my aſſured knowledge (ſaith he) of that future happy condition, ſtirreth up in my
<pb n="386" facs="tcp:42750:204"/> ſoul an earneſt deſire and longing to remove out of the body, that I may be clothed upon with glory in my ſoul after death, and with immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal glory both in ſoul and body at the day of reſurrection.</p>
            <p>By <hi>earthly houſe</hi> here, is meant our <hi>body,</hi> cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>an houſe of clay, Job</hi> 4.19. becauſe the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the firſt <hi>Adam,</hi> of whom by propagation we have our bodies, was formed out of the red earth, from which man was called <hi>Adam:</hi> it is underpropped for a time by meat, drink, ſleep, and ſometimes by medicine, to fill up the breaches, and to repair the decayes of this houſe of clay, which in end will fall down to the duſt of the earth.</p>
            <p>It is called a <hi>tabernacle;</hi> becauſe the ſoul dwells in the body for a time, as the Ark did reſide in the Tabernacle, built for divine wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip for a time in the wilderneſs; until it got a ſettled reſidence in the Temple of <hi>Jeruſalem:</hi> in like-manner, our ſouls in this time of our ſojourning on the earth, are lodged in frail bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies, ſubject to many changes, and to a conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual flux.</p>
            <p>By <hi>building,</hi> or <hi>an houſe not made with hands,</hi> is meant the immortal glorious body in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: here in this life, the parents do miniſter the materials of our frail and natural bodies; but the immortality and glory of the heavenly body, will be only from God himſelf, as is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20, 21. It is ſaid <hi>we groan,</hi>

                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) as men ſtraitned and preſſed with a burden, that hinders them to go ſo faſt in their journey as they would: therefore the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Apoſtle groans and longs to be eaſed of that burden of the body, which retards him in his motions toward his countrey that is above; and he deſires to be clothed upon with that heavenly houſe of incorruption; and to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted in that full glory, when the ſoul will be re-united unto a glorious body for ever with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſeparation; as likewiſe the body will be ever with the ſoul, and where-ever it deſires to be; for the deſire of the ſoul will be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in Heaven, as <hi>Auguſt. de Civit. Dei,</hi> ſaith truly, <hi>Protinus ubi volet ſpiritus, ihi erit cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pus,</hi> where-ever the ſpirit will deſire to be, there incontinent ſhall the body be.</p>
            <p>In the words we have, 1. The Apoſtle his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured knowledge of that far better eſtate after this life, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>For we know that if our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe,</hi> &amp;c. 2.

            <p>From the words we draw clearly theſe four Concluſions, 1. The diſſolution of the body is certain, <hi>Our earthly houſe will be diſſolved.</hi> 2. The glory of the bodies of believers in this life, is certain in the life to come, <hi>We have a building of God,</hi> &amp;c. 3. There is a great difference and oppoſition between our preſent and future con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition
<pb n="388" facs="tcp:42750:205"/> in the body: now the body of belie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers is in this life, <hi>earthly,</hi> and hath need of earthly ſupports and propps: but hereafter in Heaven it will be <hi>heavenly,</hi> in reſpect of its qualities: it will not be groſs and heavy, but ſubtile and agile; it is now corruptible, but then it will be eternal; now it is on the earth, as a poor cottage of clay in the wilderneſs; then will it be in Heaven, as a Pallace, beautiful, ſtrong and unmoveable upon Mount <hi>Zion</hi> that is above. 4. The aſſured knowledge of our intereſt and title through Chriſt unto that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py condition of glory both in ſoul and body, will ſtir up in believers a vehement deſire of that compleat happineſs in Heaven, <hi>for in this we groan,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 1. There will be a diſſolution of the body by death, <hi>For we know, that if our earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly houſe of this tabernacle were diſſolved,</hi> that is, although it were diſſolved, as the particle which is alſo here (<gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>) is well rendered, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.15. <hi>Though you have ten thouſand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructers in Chriſt:</hi> and the ſame particle is ſometimes taken for (<gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>) when, 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.2. <hi>We know that when he ſhall appear,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo it may be well rendered here alſo; <hi>when our earthly houſe of this tabernacle ſhall be diſſolved.</hi> Certain it is, it ſhall be diſſolved, <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.27. <hi>It is appointed for all, to die.</hi> Rom. 5.12, 17. <hi>Sin came over all, and by ſin alſo death.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.22. <hi>In Adam all die.</hi> Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages
<pb n="389" facs="tcp:42750:205"/> of ſin is death.</hi> If man had not ſinned, he had never died: and of this immortality of the body upon the condition of his continuance in the eſtate of innocency, the <hi>tree of life</hi> was a viſible Sacrament and ſeal of aſſurance: ſo as man was created with a poſſibility (I do not ſay, a power or inclination) to ſin or not to ſin, according as he ſhould uſe the power of his own free will: even ſo accordingly he was created with a body capable of mortality or immortality. It is a groſs errour of ſome, who have it from the <hi>Pelagians,</hi> denying Original ſin; That man would have died, although he had continued in the eſtate of innocency; by reaſon (ſay they) of the materials of the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, made up of contrary qualities, that by wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one upon another, would have made an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in the body, and in end brought cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption. But although mans body was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of contrary qualities, apt to war and wear one againſt another; yet if man had continued in harmony and correſpondence with his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors will, he would have kept theſe qualities in a juſt harmony one with another; as he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained the Lion and Wolf from devouring the Lamb and Kid in the Ark of <hi>Noah;</hi> the Lion from doing any harm to the Prophets Aſs, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 13.24. and the fire from finzing the hair of the head of the three Children, <hi>Dan.</hi> 3.27. Is it not very probable, the glorified Bodies in Heaven will have theſe ſame primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="390" facs="tcp:42750:206"/> natural qualities, and yet they will be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any alteration or corruption? is it not evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the ſentence of death was threatned only upon the condition of ſinning againſt God, <hi>The day thou eateſt, thou ſhalt die?</hi> That this is not to be underſtood only of the ſpiritual death of the ſoul, in being deprived of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of God, is clear, <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.19. <hi>In the ſweat of thy face ſhalt thou eat bread, till thou return unto the ground; for out of it was thou taken; for duſt thou art, and unto duſt ſhalt thou return.</hi> So that the ſentence formerly threatned, is exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute upon man after his failie, and for his failie.</p>
            <p>Seing this earthly houſe will be certainly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, our care of it ſhould be moderat, and not immoderat: let us not torment our ſelves with vexatious care, what we ſhall eat, or what we ſhall put on; if we have food and raiment in any competent meaſure, let us be content therewith, as ſojourners are content with a ſmall portion in the time of their ſojourning: Let your greateſt care be of your immortal ſouls, which are as a precious jewel incloſed in the body for a time: Is it not a ſhame for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons to have ſo much care, and take ſuch pains for adorning a mortal body, and in the mean time to neglect their immortal ſoul? Were it not a ſenſleſs folly in a man, to put forth all his care upon the repairing of the outſide of his houſe, and yet to have no care of the precious ſtuff and pleniſhing within it? Fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent
<pb n="391" facs="tcp:42750:206"/> meditations of the certainty of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of our bodies, would keep our ſpirits more humble and ſober in the dayes of proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and health: to this end, the very Heathens did often think upon their mortality; a Lictor or Serjeant was put into the triumphal chariot beſide the Conquerour, to put him in mind of his mortality, by crying to him, <hi>Memento te eſſe mortalem,</hi> remember thou art a mortal man. <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon</hi> commanded his Page to knock every morning at his chamber door before he roſe, and to cry, <hi>Memento mori,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member thou muſt die. The great Emperour of the Schythians, <hi>Tamberlan,</hi> in his military march, cauſed carry before him his winding-ſheet, as well as the royal ſtandart; and many of the people of God amongſt the Jews had their tombs in their gardens (as we read <hi>Joſeph</hi> of <hi>Arimathea</hi> had) to keep their ſpirits ſober in the midſt of their worldly pleaſures and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights: but mens forgetfulneſs of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching diſſolution, makes many ſo impudent and obſtinat in their ſinful courſes, <hi>Lam.</hi> 1.9. <hi>Her filthineſs is in her skirts, ſhe remembreth not her laſt end; therefore ſhe came down won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully; ſhe had no comforter.</hi> We have dayly warnings of the approaching diſſolution of this houſe of clay, 1. From the propps we make uſe of dayly to ſupport it, as our meat and our drink, they are for repairing this ruinous houſe for a time; and yet do what we can, it
<pb n="392" facs="tcp:42750:207"/> will fall down to the duſt: take warning from thy going to ſleep, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>emember, as thou puts off thy cloaths, ſo thou muſt put off this garment of mortality: If at any time thou take medicine, remember it is but as a plaiſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring for a time of a decaying mud-houſe. 2. Let ſickneſs in the body at any time, put thee in mind of thy diſſolution by death; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe alteration doth tend in end to corruption; as a drop from the roof doth in end wear the ſide-walls. 3. Take warning from the death and burial of others; when thou ſeeſt their ſcull, or bones, or duſt: this is a pious Necro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mancy thereby to divine of thine own diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by death. 4. Take warning from the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſeaſon; when thou lookeſt on the earth, thou ſeeſt neither graſs nor flower, then remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thou that, of 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.24. <hi>All fleſh is as graſs, and all the glory of man, as the flower of graſs: the graſs withereth and the flower there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of falleth away.</hi> But thou who ſoweſt in tears, rejoyce in the hope of that harveſt of compleat glory at the Reſurrection, which is the ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time of the immortality of the body; when the bodies of the Saints ſhall ſpring up in glory, like the lillies, that were hid under the ground in time of winter, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.19. <hi>Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my dead body ſhall they ariſe: awake and ſing, ye that dwell in the duſt; for thy dew, is as the dew of herbs, and the earth ſhall caſt out the dead:</hi>
            </p>
            <pb n="393" facs="tcp:42750:207"/>
            <p>There is great reaſon, wherefore we ſhould be preparing dayly for the diſſolution of the body by death, 1. This diſſolution is inevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, and there is not exemption from it by any humane power. It is true, God himſelf did exempt <hi>Enoch</hi> and <hi>Elias</hi> from diſſolution of the body; becauſe he is the ſupreme Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, and may diſpence with his own penal ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes: but no perſon can exempt himſelf from the neceſſity of a diſſolution of the body: riches cannot bribe death; the rich glutton died: honour and majeſty in the great ones of the world, cannot daſh death out of countenance, nor chaſe it away; Kings are laid in their graves: might and power of Armies cannot affright death; it has taken away Kings and great Commanders upon the head of their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, wiſdom and eloquence cannot diſſwade it from approaching; the wiſe and eloquent die, as well as fools and ignorant men. The Piety of the godly, will not turn it away; <hi>Abraham</hi> the fathe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> of the faithful, and all the Patriarchs died. 2. This diſſolution is uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in reſpect of the time, manner, and place: We come into the world one way, but go out of it a thouſand divers wayes: that rich world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 12.18.) was taken away on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; the Shunamit's ſon goeth forth well in the morning, but dies before the evening: though our dayes are numbred of God, yet they are uncertain to us: our breath is in our
<pb n="394" facs="tcp:42750:208"/> noſtrils; if either the air we draw in, or the air we breath out, be ſtopped, we are gone in an inſtant: if but the ſmall paſſages from the reins be obſtructed, our heart is ſuffocat. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore let us not in our vain preſumption number years unto our ſelves; but let us pray daily to God, that he would teach us ſo to number our dayes, that we may apply our hearts unto wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 90 12.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> How ſhall I be prepared for my diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution and death? <hi>Anſ.</hi> That thou mayeſt be prepared, 1. Repent of thy ſins, and be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled unto God through faith in Jeſus Chriſt the Mediator, without delaying, even while thou art in the way, and cannot tell how ſoon thou mayeſt be removed, that thou may appear before thy Judge, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5.25. Delay not till the very term of thy diſſolution be come; for then it will be with thee as with a careleſs debt or, who takes no courſe with his debts in time; at the term-day he is confounded with fear, leſt death as a rude Meſſenger, ſent from the great Judge, ſhall hale him to the bottomleſs priſon, from which there is no redemption. 2. Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Chriſt the Saviour of ſinners into the arms of thy faith, that ſo with old <hi>Simeon</hi> thou mayeſt depart in peace, <hi>Luk.</hi> 2.29, 30.

               <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 2. The future glory of the bodies of the Saints in Heaven, is not only ſure and certain, in it ſelf, in reſpect of the object pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by God; but alſo in reſpect of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to wit, believers on the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who may and ſhould be aſſured of it; for it is ſaid here by the Apoſtle, not only in his own name, but alſo in the name of all believers on Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>We know we have an houſe,</hi> &amp;c. It is expreſſed in the preſent tenſe, (<gap reason="foreign">

And <hi>David,</hi> Pſal. 17.15 <hi>As for me, I will behold thy face in righteouſneſs: I ſhall be ſatisfied when I awake, with thy likeneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The reaſons are, 1. Becauſe not only the ſoul, but alſo the body of a believer, is a part of the myſtical Body of Chriſt, who is the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour of his whole body, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.23. 2. As the body of believers, is an inſtrument and veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel of honour to God in this life; ſo theſe ſame bodies ſhall be veſſels of glory in the other life, that they may receive there according to their ſervice done unto God here in the body, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.10. 3. The bodies of the Patriarchs, do now reſt in their graves; and as we may be aſſured, they ſhall be raiſed unto glory, <hi>Matth.</hi> 22.32. <hi>Joh.</hi> 5 28, 29. So all true believers on Jeſus Chriſt, may be aſſured, that their own bodies alſo ſhall be raiſed in glory unto eternal life.</p>
            <p>As we would be aſſured of glory to our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies in heaven, let us uſe our bodies here as temples to the Holy Ghoſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the dead, dwell in you, he that raiſed up Chriſt from the dead, ſhall alſo quicken your mortal bodies by his Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that dwelleth in you.</hi> Now the body is uſed as a temple to the Holy Ghoſt, 1. by ſeparat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

As the temple of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> was not only ſeparat from a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane or common uſe, but was alſo dedicat and conſecrat unto the ſervice of God, and ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual employments; in like manner, our bodies ſhould be preſented and dedicat to the ſervice of God, according to the duty of our Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian calling, <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.1. <hi>I beſeech you therefore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye preſent your bodies a living ſacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is your reaſonable ſervice.</hi> As all the veſſels in the Temple, whether great or ſmall, were holy; ſo ſhould all the members of our body be employed unto righteouſneſs, <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.13. <hi>Neither yield ye your members as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of unrighteouſneſs unto ſin; but yield your ſelves unto God, as thoſe that are alive from the dead, and your members as inſtruments of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs unto God.</hi> Our eyes ſhould be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed away from beholding vanity, and imployed

There is an oppoſition in reſpect of the feature and beauty of the body; <hi>The bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy is ſown in diſhonour, but raiſed in honour.</hi> Our body in this life, is called a vile body, <hi>Phil.</hi> 3.20. <hi>Saccus ſtercorum;</hi> and the greateſt on earth muſt carry about with them theſe monitories of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility: A little time before death, the face be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes pale and earth-like; as wine near-run, doth ſmell of the dreg: after the ſoul is gone, like an heavenly ſpark of fire out of a mud-houſe, then the body becomes naſty and loathſome through ſtench. <hi>Abraham</hi> deſired to bury his ſome-time beautiful <hi>Sarah</hi> out of his ſight. But in the day of reſurrection the bodies of the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly will be raiſed in honour, like unto the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous body of Chriſt.

There is an oppoſition in reſpect of the healthful diſpoſition and conſtitution of the body; <hi>It is ſown in weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, but will be raiſed in power.</hi> The beſt conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of the body now, in compariſon of that it had in the eſtate of innocency, is at the beſt but weakneſs: although all bodies now be not alike weak; yet a ſharp fit of an ague, or of the ſtone will lay the ſtrongeſt man on his back; even the ſtrongeſt bodies through much labour do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak and feeble, as a ſtrong bow, through much ſhooting, becomes flug and remiſs: <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> notwithſtanding his great ſtrength, became weary and thirſty after his fight with the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines; and on death-bed the ſtrongeſt man is not able to carry a drink to his own head, or to turn

The number of the Elect, and of the Church

The glorified body will not have any uſe or need of meat, drink or ſleep, becauſe the body then will be of a fixed and durable conſtitution and conſiſtence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all poſſibility of alteration or decay, <hi>Rev.</hi> 7.16 In heaven the body will be ſpiritual, in reſpect of lucidity and agility in motion; like unto the celeſtial Spirits and Angels, who in a very ſhort time make their motions through a vaſt ſpace and interval, as the Angel <hi>Gabriel</hi> did, <hi>Dan.</hi> 9.23. In like manner, our bodies then will be carryed quickly in an imperceptible moment of time, whereſoever our ſouls ſhall deſire to be, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi>
               <pb n="405" facs="tcp:42750:213"/> 4.17. <hi>We ſhallbe caught up together with them in the clouds to meet the Lord in the air.</hi> As for theſe members of the body, which in this life ſerve for neceſſar and natural uſe, they will ſerve in heaven for ornament and integrity of the body: as the breaſts of the woman come to old age, who ſometimes gave ſuck; although in old age they will not ſerve for that uſe, yet they do ſtill ſerve for the ornament and integrity of the body.</p>
            <p>Herefrom is matter of great comfort to the godly, who ſuffer hard things in the body here: be of good courage ye are not to dwell for ever in that ſilly frail houſe; at the term of removal by death, ye know of a durable houſe; now it is mouldering down daily, like an houſe of clay after a great ſhower; but in heaven ye will have a manſion and fixed ſtation in your fathers houſe, <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.2. Although poſſibly there be ſenſible weakneſs, or viſible deformity now in thy body; yet be thou patient in the hope thy body will be raiſed in ſtrength and beauty, as the body of <hi>Lazarus,</hi> without any ſores: It is true, after the Reſurrection of our bleſſed Lord, the print of the nails remained in his hands and feet, as alſo the hole of the wound in his ſide; but that was for a ſhort time out of his merciful condeſcenſion to cure <hi>Thomas</hi> his doubting; as alſo his eating (<hi>Joh.</hi> 21.) was not to ſatisfie neceſſity, for then his body was glorious and immortal; but it was to feed and confirm their faith of the Reſurrection of his body. 3. Though now thou be weary in the body after much labour, ſo was our bleſſed Lord in this, like unto us, as in all things, except ſin, <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.6. But be of good comfort, thou who exerciſeſt thy ſelf in well-doing, ſhalt riſe
<pb n="406" facs="tcp:42750:214"/> in the body, as one refreſhed in the morning after a ſound and quiet ſleep<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then ſhalt thou be like unto Angels, in doing the will of thy Lord with all chear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, without all poſſibility of wearineſs. 4. Now in the body thou art ſometimes troubled about a livelyhood and things neceſſar; but after the Reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection thou ſhalt be ſatisfied to the full both in ſoul and body with the fruition of our all-ſufficient and unchangable God; even with that hid Manna of the ſweet<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> full, and unſpeakable variety of delight, both in the ſenſe of the love of God toward thee, and in the ſenſe of thy love reflected on God, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.17. <hi>To him that overcometh, will I give to eat of the hidden man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na.</hi> 5. Now thou art moleſted and faſhed with the ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rings of inordinat concupiſcence dwelling in the body, as <hi>Sarah</hi> was grieved with <hi>Hagar,</hi> dwelling in the ſame houſe with her: but it is thy comfort, after the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, as there will be perfect calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in the affections, without the leaſt unruly motion; ſo in all the members of the glorified body, there will be perfect quietneſs; as when the ſea is calm, there is no agitation in the Ship. 6. Though now at the diſſolution of the body, and at the departure of its noble gueſt the <hi>immortal ſoul,</hi> there may be, and oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times is, much pain and agony, like unto the grief <hi>Jacob</hi> had at parting with his dear <hi>Benjamin:</hi> yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce thou in the hope of that joyful meeting again of thy ſoul and body, as the joy was great when <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Joſeph</hi> met again together: the glorified ſoul will bring glad tydings from heaven to the body, like the faithful ſpyes, <hi>Num.</hi> 14. for the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the body to go along with it to the third hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven: this joy will be increaſed at their meeting with Chriſt, accompanyed with millions of Angels; and it will be perpetuated with him in the paradiſe of

               <hi>Concluſ.</hi> 4. The aſſured knowledge believers have of that happy eſtate of ſoul and body in Heaven, ſtir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reth up in them an earneſt deſire after the fruition of it; for it is ſaid, <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. <hi>We know,</hi> &amp;c. and, <hi>verſ.</hi> 2. <hi>In this we groan earneſtly,</hi> &amp;c. for the knowledge and perſwaſion of the truth of the <hi>good</hi> ſet before us, doth ſtir up the heart to deſire, quickens us to diligence in uſing all lawful means for attaining the <hi>good</hi> deſired; and encourageth us againſt difficulties in the way: The pleaſantneſs and fertility of the land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> ſeen and known to the faithful ſpyes, (<hi>Numb.</hi> 14.) ſtirred up in them an earneſt deſire of poſſeſſing the promiſed land; it quickened them to diligence in the way, and gave them courage againſt the ſons of <hi>Anak.</hi> who were to oppoſe them in their way to it, <hi>Numb.</hi> 14.9. The Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> knowing it was beſt to be with Chriſt, did deſire to be diſſolved, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. This deſire made him diligent and faithful in all the parts, both of his Chriſtian and Apoſtolick Calling; it made him alſo couragious and reſolute againſt all difficulties and diſcouragements, <hi>Acts</hi> 21.13. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.16, 18. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.12. But groſs ignorants, who know or believe nothing concerning the compleat happineſs of ſoul and body in Heaven, have no true or well-grounded deſire to remove out of the body: and wicked obſtinat ſinners, though they have ſome literal knowledge of it; yet they have not that lively hope, which purifieth the heart; and therefore at death they are driven out of the body, ſore againſt their will, as a Malefactor condemned, is forced from his houſe to the priſon, <hi>Job</hi> 18.18. <hi>He ſhall be driven from light into darkneſs, and chaſed out of the world.</hi> As in his lifetime, the wicked man ruſhed into ſin, like an horſe into the battel, without all fear of God: ſo he ſhall be driven as a beaſt into that dark and bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomleſs
<pb n="408" facs="tcp:42750:215"/> priſon; he ſhall be chaſed and purſued with the fears and terrours of an evil conſcience, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 140.11. <hi>Evil ſhall hunt the violent man to overthrow him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> But ſometimes even the godly are unwilling to die, as was <hi>Hezekiah, Iſai.</hi> 38.10. and <hi>David, Pſ.</hi> 39.13. What is the cauſe of this unwillingneſs in them who walked uprightly before the Lord? <hi>Anſ.</hi> The cauſes are, 1. An immoderat love ſometimes in the godly toward ſome of their neareſt and deareſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations: it maketh them to linger in their deſires and reſolutions to die; as <hi>Lot</hi> did linger in his departing out of <hi>Sodom Gen.</hi> 19.16. his great affection to his ſons-in-law, made him ling<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>r longer than he ſhould: but when death takes the godly by the heart, as the Angel did <hi>Lot</hi> by the hand, then they are willing to ſubmit to the will of God; and they ſay, as our bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Lord did at his death, <hi>Father, into thy hands I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend my ſpirit.</hi> 2. Their deſire to do good in their ſtation in the world, is a cauſe of their unwillingneſs to remove for a time from that ſtation: and this I think made <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> ſomewhat unwilling, out of their great reſpect to the people of God over whom they were ſet: this made <hi>Paul</hi> to hover, and to be in a ſtrait, whether to depart or abide in the fleſh; even his great deſire to benefit the Church of Chriſt, by preaching the Goſpel, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. Theſe are truly pious deſires and commendable purpoſes; yet when the children of God perceive it is Gods peremptory will to remove them by death, they commend their ſpirits to God, and the care of all their concernments unto their wiſe Lord, who can raiſe up a <hi>Joſhua</hi> in the place of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and an <hi>Eliſha</hi> in the place of <hi>Elijah,</hi> and alſo enable them with the ſpirit of their Calling. It is alſo a natural and pious deſire of godly Parents, to live that they may bring up their young children in the knowledge and the fear of the Lord, and under
<pb n="409" facs="tcp:42750:215"/> God provide for them: nevertheleſs when they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it is Gods will to remove them by death from their children, they willingly ſubmit themſelves to the will of God; and as they caſt themſelves and the care of their ſoul upon the God of their ſalvation; ſo with confidence they commit their children to God, who taketh this title unto himſelf, to be <hi>the father of the fatherleſs.</hi> And I know well, the God of truth doth not aſſume empty titles; but is fully anſwerable unto them in the work of his gracious and fatherly providence. 3. A cauſe of their unwillingneſs to die, is ſometimes their want of full aſſurance of the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their ſins, and of the ſalvation of their ſouls: but if they had this, they profeſs they would be moſt willing to die. For anſwer to this ſcruple, I confeſs it is no wonder the child of God deſire this full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance; becauſe the more they have of a well-ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſurance, they have the more of inward peace and comfort: yet though thou have not that full aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, which is called <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>
               <hi>Queſt.</hi> What are the means and helps to make the children of God willing to remove out of the body? <hi>Anſ.</hi> 1. A ſpecial mean is that, ſet down here in the Text, to wit, the aſſured knowledge of a far better eſtate after this life: <hi>Moſes,</hi> a little time before his death, went up to the top of <hi>Piſgah, Deut.</hi> 34. and there the Lord ſhewed unto him the pleaſant and plentiful land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> that was on the other ſide of <hi>Jordan;</hi> after which ſight, he willingly died there: in like-manner the Lord our God, for their further encouragement, elevats the minds of his children, by the eye of faith, toward their eternal reſt in Heaven; then their hearts are ſo affected with love and deſire to be there with Chriſt, that they ſay as <hi>Paul</hi> did, <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.23. <hi>I deſire to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt, which is beſt of all.</hi> Old <hi>Simeon,</hi> a long expectant of glory, waited for Chriſt, <hi>the conſolation of Iſrael;</hi> and

In like-manner, <hi>faith</hi> embracing Chriſt the Saviour, and the hope of ſalvation in him and with him, doth depart in peace. 2. The ſeal of the Holy Spirit, in the work and courſe of our ſanctification, doth encourage and make us willing to die<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> as the Seal of earthly Kings, make ſure to men their earthly poſſeſſions; ſo the King of kings, by the Seal of the Holy Spirit, as our Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication is called, (<hi>Eph.</hi> 1.13) maketh ſure unto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers their heavenly inheritance, which is ſaid to be among them which are ſanctified by faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>Acts</hi> 26.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>8. Therefore as ye would die willingly in the hope of that heavenly inheritance, be very careful, that your gift thereof paſs not only through the Common Seal of the outward Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of hearing the Word, and receiving the holy Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>craments; but alſo through the Privy Seal of purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſanctifying the heart; for, <hi>Bleſſed are they that are pure in heart, they ſhall ſee God,</hi> Mat. 5.8. and <hi>without holineſs none ſhall ſee God,</hi> Heb. 12.14. There is no coming unto the heavenly inheritance without regeneration as a child yet unborn cannot actually have the poſſeſſion of an inheritance. 3. The earneſt of the Spirit, which is alſo called, <hi>The firſt fruits of the Spirit, (Rom.</hi> 8.23.) maketh a man willing to die: as a man receiving, though a ſmall earneſt-peny out of the hand of one that is faithful and able to perform the whole bargain at the term, doth truſt to his faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful promiſe; and withal having received ſome ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt of the promiſed ſum; the nearer the term of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance is<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he is the more joyful: In like-manner, the child of God, having ſometime received an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt or firſt-fruits of his ſalvation, in the ſenſe of Gods love, ſhed abroad in his heart by the Holy Ghoſt;
<pb n="412" facs="tcp:42750:217"/> ſome peace in his conſcience by faith in Jeſus Chriſt the Saviour of ſinners; and ſome joy of the promiſed ſalvation, from a lively hope to be with Chriſt; the nearer he is to the term of his removal, he is or may be the more joyful: ſo it was with the Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> 2 Cor. 5 8. <hi>He alſo hath given unto us the earneſt of the Spirit; therefore we are confident and willing rather to be abſent from the body, and to be preſent with the Lord.</hi> Theſe firſt fruits of the Spirit in the ſoul, are like unto theſe few cluſters <hi>Joſhua</hi> and <hi>Caleb</hi> brought from the valley of <hi>Eſhcol;</hi> they give ſome refreſhment to the ſoul, and withall encourage it to go forward to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, where they ſhall get no worſe, but much more of ſuch fruits. Although thou haſt not ſuch a mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the ſenſe of Gods love towards thee, as thou deſireſt: yet if there be in thine heart a true and ſincere hatred of all ſin; and a true and deep ſenſe of thine own love toward God, that thou mayeſt ſay in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility and ſincerity, as <hi>Peter</hi> did, Joh. 21. <hi>Lord, thou that knoweſt all things, knoweth I love thee:</hi> then mayeſt thou die willingly, becauſe (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.9.) <hi>Eye hath not ſeen,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>what God hath prepared for them that love him.</hi> 1 Cor. 8.3. <hi>If any man love God, the ſame is known and approven of him.</hi> Peace in thy conſcience, from faith reſting on Jeſus Chriſt and his perfect righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, is the earneſt of thy full and everlaſting peace in Heaven, when thou ſhalt ſee God as he is. Although thy peace of Sanctification may be inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted now and then by thy ſinning ſometimes againſt thy light, as it was in <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 51. yet in Heaven there will be perfect righteouſneſs inherent for ever, and the fruit thereof will be perfect and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting peace in the ſoul. Spiritual joy, which is called the joy of the Holy Ghoſt, becauſe he is the Author of it; and is alſo called the joy of ſalvation, becauſe eternal ſalvation in Heaven is the object of it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="413" facs="tcp:42750:217"/> if at any time God hath given joy to thy heart after thy mourning in ſecret for thy ſins; and after thy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving in Jeſus Chriſt, who came into the world to ſave even the chief of ſinners; then look thou upon that joy, as a love-token ſent down to thee from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; and as an earneſt of that full and everlaſting joy in Heaven that ſhall never be taken from thee. This conſideration and joyful expectation maketh the children of God willing to be diſſolved, and to be with Chriſt at whoſe right hand is fulneſs of joy, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures for ever: For if there be ſuch joy from the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and firſt fruits, that it is called, (1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.8.) <hi>Joy unſpeakable and full of glory,</hi> What will the joy be after this life, when we ſhall receive the full ſum of glory, and ſhall reap the full harveſt of joy in the kingdom of Heaven? It is true, ſome of the dear chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God, who ſometimes in their lifetime have had peace in their conſcience, and joy in their heart from the hope of ſalvation, have been a little before their death under a cloud and great wreſtlings againſt tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ptations to unbelief and deſpondency, which were fierce as the ſons of <hi>Anak</hi> at their coming out of this wilderneſs: but before their diſſolution, that cloud eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, and they expreſt their joy, like the joy of the wiſe men, when they ſaw the Star that led them to Chriſt appearing again, <hi>Mat.</hi> 2.10. and they cried out, <hi>Venit venit, He is come, he is come;</hi> And then they ſay, (as <hi>Iſa.</hi> 25.9.) <hi>This is the Lord<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> we have waited for him, we will be glad, and rejoyce in his ſalvation.</hi>

Like unto loving and dutiful children in the time of their travels abroad, who are afraid to do any thing
<pb n="414" facs="tcp:42750:218"/> in a ſtrange countrey, that may diſhonour their loving father, who ſent them to their travels for a time, and bare all their charges in the time of their abſence: this fear to diſhonour our heavenly Father, and our active care to honour him in this preſent world, will make us willing and confident to return unto him at death, who will make us welcome at our return, and give us reſt in theſe eternal manſions in our Fathers houſe: this fear to offend God, and care to pleaſe him in all things, made the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> willing and confident in the thoughts of his departure from this world, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.7, 8 <hi>I have fought a good fight,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>henceforth there is laid up for me a Crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord, the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judge ſhall give me at that day; and not to me only, but unto all them alſo, that love his appearing.</hi> 2. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider often the place thou leaveſt at death, and the place thou goeſt to after death; and the vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween theſe two, as the Heaven is diſtant from the Earth: thou leaveſt a world of iniquity and miſery; but goeſt to that other world, wherein dwelleth righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs &amp; all happineſs: there is a vaſt difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the earthly houſe thou flitts from at death, and that eternal houſe and manſion to which thy ſoul flitts immediatly after death, and ſhall reſt from all thy la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13. Thy ſoul dwelleth now in a dark houſe; there is much ignorance even in the beſt of Saints here: and any light or knowledge we have now in the body, is but like the light unto a priſoner in the dungeon, through crevices and ſlitts, by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry of our outward ſenſes, our hearing and ſeeing: but in that heavenly manſion, whereto the believer goeth at death, there is full light, <hi>Pſ.</hi> 36.9. <hi>In thy light ſhall we ſee light.</hi> 1 Joh. 3.2. <hi>We ſhall ſee him as he is.</hi> There will be an identity in the object, <hi>God himſelf,</hi> ſeen by all the glorified Saints: yet there is an infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nit variety of all things deſireable for our happineſs, to
